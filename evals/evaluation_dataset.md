8. Retest and repeat if needed

**Key Points to Check:**
- Should emphasize brushing before AND after
- Should mention adjusting pH BEFORE shocking
- Should mention running pump continuously
- Should mention vacuuming dead algae to waste
- Should NOT just say "add chlorine" without the full process
