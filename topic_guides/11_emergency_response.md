## 3. EPA Pool Disinfection Guidelines

### Acceptable Chlorine Levels

**Regular Operation:**
- Free chlorine: 1-3 ppm (recommended)
- Maximum safe level: 4 ppm
- Combined chlorine: < 0.5 ppm

**After Fecal Incident:**
- Formed stool: Raise FC to 2 ppm for 25 minutes
- Diarrheal incident: Raise FC to 20 ppm for 12.75 hours (at pH 7.5)
- Document treatment and closure time

### Cryptosporidium Response

**If Crypto is suspected:**
1. Close pool immediately
2. Document incident
3. Superchlorinate (20 ppm FC)
4. Maintain for required time
5. Verify chlorine level before reopening
6. Report to health department if required

### pH and Disinfection

**pH affects chlorine effectiveness:**
| pH Level | Chlorine Effectiveness |
|----------|----------------------|
| 7.0 | ~75% as HOCl |
| 7.5 | ~50% as HOCl |
| 8.0 | ~25% as HOCl |

**Maintain pH 7.2-7.8 for optimal disinfection**

- Report issues to facility
- Educate customers when appropriate

**Key Parameters for RWI Prevention:**
- Free chlorine: 1-3 ppm
- pH: 7.2-7.8
- Regular testing (commercial: every 2-4 hours)
- Proper circulation

### Fecal Incident Response

**Formed Stool:**
1. Remove as much as possible
2. Raise FC to 2 ppm
3. Maintain pH 7.5 or lower
4. Keep pool closed 25 minutes
5. Document incident and response

**Diarrheal Stool (Crypto Risk):**
1. Close pool immediately
2. Remove visible matter
3. Raise FC to 20 ppm
4. Maintain for 12.75 hours (pH 7.5)
5. Longer times for higher pH
6. Verify levels before reopening
7. Document thoroughly
