# Pool Pumps Guide for Service Technicians

## Overview
The pool pump is the heart of the circulation system. Understanding how pumps work and common issues is essential for every pool technician.

## 1. How Pool Pumps Work

### Basic Components
- **Motor**: Powers the impeller (typically 0.5-3 HP)
- **Impeller**: Spinning disc that creates suction
- **Strainer Basket**: Catches debris before impeller
- **Seal**: Prevents water from reaching motor
- **Volute**: Housing that directs water flow

### The Circulation Process
1. Pump creates suction through skimmers and main drain
2. Water passes through strainer basket
3. Impeller spins water at high speed
4. Water pushes to filter, then returns to pool

### Pump Types
| Type | Efficiency | Best For | Cost |
|------|------------|----------|------|
| Single-Speed | Low (runs full power) | Basic pools, budget | $ |
| Dual-Speed | Moderate | Mid-range efficiency | $$ |
| Variable-Speed | High (adjustable RPM) | Energy savings, larger pools | $$$ |

## 2. How Long to Run Your Pump

### Turnover Rate Calculation
**Goal**: Turn over entire pool volume at least once per 8-12 hours

**Formula:**
```
Pool Volume (gallons) ÷ Pump GPM = Hours to turnover
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Pool: 20,000 gallons
- Pump flow rate: 50 GPM
- Calculation: 20,000 ÷ 50 = 400 minutes = 6.7 hours
- Recommendation: Run 8 hours minimum

### Seasonal Adjustments
| Season | Run Time | Why |
|--------|----------|-----|
| Summer | 10-12 hours | Higher temps, more use, algae risk |
| Spring/Fall | 6-8 hours | Moderate conditions |
| Winter | 4-6 hours | Minimal use, cooler temps |

### Variable Speed Pump Scheduling
- Run at LOW speed (1500-2000 RPM) for 12-16 hours
- Lower speed = less energy, still adequate circulation
- Use HIGH speed for vacuuming, pool cleaners

## 3. Pump Won't Prime - Troubleshooting

### What is Priming?
Priming = pump filled with water, creating suction. Air in the system breaks the prime.

### Common Causes

**1. Air Leaks (Suction Side)**
- Check: Pump lid O-ring - cracked, dry, or improperly seated
- Check: Pump drain plugs - missing or loose
- Check: Pipe fittings before pump - cracks, loose connections
- Check: Valve stems - worn O-rings

**2. Water Level Issues**
- Skimmer water level too low
- Suction line blockage
- Clogged skimmer basket

**3. Clogged Impeller**
- Debris wrapped around impeller
- Reduced suction even when primed

**4. Suction Line Problems**
- Valve closed or partially closed
- Blockage in underground line
- Cracked suction pipe

### Step-by-Step Priming Procedure
1. Turn off pump
2. Open pump lid, fill strainer with water
3. Check and lubricate lid O-ring
4. Replace lid, hand-tighten
5. Open all suction valves fully
6. Turn on pump
7. Watch for water to fill strainer (should happen in 30-60 seconds)

### If Pump Still Won't Prime
1. Check for air bubbles in pump strainer (indicates air leak)
2. Feel suction pipes for air being sucked in
3. Use shaving cream test on fittings (cream gets sucked in at leak)
4. Check valve actuators and stems
5. Inspect underground lines for cracks

## 4. Clogged Impeller

### Warning Signs
- Reduced water flow but pump is running
- Pump strainer full but weak suction
- Motor running hot
- Unusual noise from pump

### How to Clear a Clogged Impeller

**Tools Needed:**
- Screwdriver
- Needle-nose pliers or impeller cleaning tool
- Flashlight

**Steps:**
1. Turn off pump at breaker
2. Remove pump lid and strainer basket
3. Look into impeller throat (use flashlight)
4. Remove visible debris with pliers
5. Rotate impeller by hand to check for binding
6. For stubborn debris: Remove pump from plumbing
7. Access impeller from back of pump
8. Clean all vanes thoroughly
9. Reassemble and test

### Prevention
- Keep strainer basket clean
- Maintain proper water level
- Use skimmer socks for fine debris
- Check strainer weekly

## 5. Motor Issues

### Motor Won't Start
| Symptom | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| No sound | No power, bad capacitor | Check breaker, test capacitor |
| Humming only | Seized bearings, bad capacitor | Replace bearings or motor |
| Clicks then stops | Overload tripping | Check for obstruction, voltage |
| Runs then shuts off | Overheating | Check ventilation, amperage |

### Motor Running Hot
- Check voltage (should be within 10% of nameplate)
- Verify adequate ventilation around motor
- Check amp draw (should not exceed nameplate)
- Look for obstructed impeller
- Consider motor replacement if bearings are worn

### Capacitor Testing
1. Discharge capacitor safely
2. Use multimeter on capacitance setting
3. Reading should be within 10% of rated value
4. Replace if out of range or bulging

### Weekly
- [ ] Clean strainer basket
- [ ] Check for air bubbles in strainer
- [ ] Listen for unusual sounds
- [ ] Verify adequate flow

### Monthly
- [ ] Inspect pump lid O-ring (lubricate with silicone)
- [ ] Check for leaks around pump
- [ ] Verify motor is not overheating
- [ ] Clean pump exterior

### Annually
- [ ] Inspect impeller for wear
- [ ] Check shaft seal for leaks
- [ ] Verify motor amp draw
- [ ] Clean motor vents
