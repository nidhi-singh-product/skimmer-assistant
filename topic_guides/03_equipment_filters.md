# Pool Filters Guide for Service Technicians

## Overview
Pool filters remove debris and particles from the water. Understanding the three filter types and their maintenance is crucial for water clarity and system efficiency.

## 1. Filter Types Comparison

| Feature | Sand Filter | Cartridge Filter | DE Filter |
|---------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Filtration** | 20-40 microns | 10-20 microns | 2-5 microns |
| **Maintenance** | Backwash | Clean/Replace | Backwash + Add DE |
| **Best For** | Large pools, low maintenance | Smaller pools, water conservation | Best clarity, commercial |
| **Lifespan** | 5-7 years (sand) | 1-3 years (cartridge) | 1-2 years (grids) |
| **Cost** | $$ | $ | $$$ |

## 2. Filter Pressure - Understanding PSI

### Normal Operating Pressure
- Every filter has its own "clean" baseline pressure
- Record the clean pressure after new sand/cartridge/DE
- Normal range varies: typically 8-15 PSI when clean

### Pressure Guidelines
| Reading | Status | Action |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Clean baseline | Normal | No action needed |
| 8-10 PSI above baseline | Time to clean | Backwash or clean cartridge |
| 25+ PSI | Critical | Immediate attention required |
| 0 PSI or very low | Problem | Check pump, gauge, or blockage |

### High Pressure Causes
1. Dirty filter media (most common)
2. Clogged return lines
3. Closed or partially closed valve
4. Undersized plumbing
5. Failed multiport valve gasket (sand filters)

### Low Pressure Causes
1. Pump not priming properly
2. Clogged impeller
3. Air leak in suction side
4. Faulty pressure gauge
5. Broken or worn internal parts

---

## 3. Sand Filters

### How They Work
- Water flows through bed of filter sand
- Sand traps particles 20-40 microns
- Dirty water goes in top, clean water exits bottom
- Backwashing reverses flow to flush debris

### When to Backwash
- Pressure rises 8-10 PSI above clean baseline
- Weekly during heavy use seasons
- After vacuuming large debris
- After treating algae

### Backwash Procedure
1. Turn pump OFF
2. Set multiport valve to BACKWASH
3. Turn pump ON
4. Watch sight glass - run until water clears (2-3 minutes)
5. Turn pump OFF
6. Set valve to RINSE
7. Turn pump ON for 30-60 seconds
8. Turn pump OFF
9. Set valve back to FILTER
10. Turn pump ON
11. Check and record new pressure

### Changing Sand Filter Media

**When to Replace:**
- Every 5-7 years
- Water clarity issues despite backwashing
- Channeling visible (sand caked with oils/debris)
- Sand coming into pool

**Sand Replacement Steps:**
1. Turn off pump, relieve pressure
2. Remove multiport valve or top assembly
3. Cover standpipe to prevent sand entry
4. Scoop or vacuum out old sand
5. Fill tank halfway with water (cushions standpipe)
6. Add new #20 silica sand (amount per manufacturer)
7. Reassemble multiport valve with new gasket
8. Backwash for 2 minutes before filtering

**Sand Quantity by Filter Size:**
| Tank Diameter | Sand Required |
|---------------|---------------|
| 19" | 150 lbs |
| 24" | 300 lbs |
| 30" | 500 lbs |

## 4. Cartridge Filters

### How They Work
- Pleated fabric element traps particles
- Water flows from outside in
- Finer filtration than sand (10-20 microns)
- No backwash - remove and clean cartridge

### Cleaning Procedure
1. Turn off pump
2. Relieve pressure (air relief valve)
3. Remove tank lid/clamp band
4. Remove cartridge element(s)
5. Rinse with garden hose (work between pleats)
6. For heavy soiling: Soak in filter cleaner overnight
7. Rinse thoroughly
8. Inspect for damage/wear
9. Reinstall and reassemble
10. Turn on pump, bleed air

### When to Replace Cartridge
- Frayed or flattened pleats
- Tears or holes in fabric
- End caps cracked or separated
- Cannot maintain pressure after cleaning
- Typically every 1-3 years depending on use

### Cartridge Cleaning Tips
- Keep a spare cartridge for rotation
- Use cartridge cleaning solution for oils/lotions
- Never use high-pressure washer (damages pleats)
- Let dry completely between uses for best results

## 5. DE (Diatomaceous Earth) Filters

### How They Work
- Grids covered with DE powder
- DE is fossilized diatoms - extremely fine filtration
- Filters down to 2-5 microns (clearest water)
- Requires adding DE after each backwash

### Backwash Procedure
1. Turn pump OFF
2. Open backwash valve or set multiport to BACKWASH
3. Turn pump ON
4. Run until water clears (2-3 minutes)
5. Turn pump OFF
6. Close backwash valve or return to FILTER
7. Turn pump ON
8. Add new DE through skimmer

### How Much DE to Add
**General Rule:** 1 lb of DE per 10 sq ft of filter area

| Filter Size | DE Required |
|-------------|-------------|
| 24 sq ft | 2.5 lbs |
| 36 sq ft | 3.5 lbs |
| 48 sq ft | 5 lbs |
| 60 sq ft | 6 lbs |
| 72 sq ft | 7 lbs |

### Adding DE
1. Mix DE with water in bucket to make slurry
2. Pour slowly into running skimmer
3. Distribute evenly across grids
4. Monitor pressure

### Annual Grid Cleaning
1. Remove filter grids
2. Soak in filter cleaner solution
3. Hose off thoroughly
4. Inspect for tears or damage
5. Reassemble with new DE

## 6. Troubleshooting Filter Problems

### Sand/DE Coming Into Pool

**Sand Filter:**
- Cracked lateral
- Broken standpipe
- Wrong sand size used
- Sand needs replacement

**DE Filter:**
- Torn grid fabric
- Cracked manifold
- Damaged grid
- Air leak allowing DE bypass

### Filter Won't Hold Pressure

| Filter Type | Check This |
|-------------|------------|
| Sand | Multiport valve gasket, laterals |
| Cartridge | O-ring seals, cracked housing |
| DE | Air relief valve, tank clamp |

### Water Still Cloudy After Cleaning

1. Check chemistry first (pH, chlorine)
2. Verify filter is sized correctly for pool
3. Increase run time
4. Check for air leaks
5. Consider clarifier or flocculant
6. May need media replacement
