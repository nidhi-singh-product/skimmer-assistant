# Heater Safety Systems and Diagnostics

## Essential Elements for Heater Operation

For a gas heater to operate, four essential elements must be present:
1. **Water** - Adequate flow through the heat exchanger
2. **Electricity** - Proper voltage to controls and ignition
3. **Air** - Proper ventilation for combustion
4. **Gas** - Correct pressure and supply

## Safety Switch Systems

Heaters are equipped with multiple safety switches that must ALL be satisfied before the heater will fire. Never bypass a safety switch—they exist to prevent catastrophic failure, fire, or carbon monoxide poisoning.

### Pressure Switch
- **Function**: Senses that the pump is running and there is adequate water flow
- **Requirement**: Minimum 40 GPM flow rate
- **Failure Mode**: Heater will not ignite if flow is insufficient
- **Common Issues**: Dirty or clogged filter reducing flow, pump issues

### High Limit Switch (HLS)
- **Function**: Monitors water temperature inside the heat exchanger
- **Trip Point**: Opens at approximately 135°F
- **Purpose**: Prevents overheating and potential burns
- **Reset**: May require manual reset after tripping

### Air Flow Switch
- **Function**: Works with the blower to ensure proper air intake and ventilation
- **Purpose**: Ensures proper combustion air and exhaust
- **Failure Mode**: Heater will not fire if ventilation is inadequate
- **Common Issues**: Blocked vents, failed blower motor

### Automatic Gas Shut-off (AGS)
- **Function**: Secondary high-limit safety switch
- **Trip Point**: Opens at approximately 140°F
- **Purpose**: Redundant protection against overheating
- **Location**: Separate from HLS for backup protection

### Stack Flue Sensor (SFS)
- **Function**: Monitors the exhaust vent temperature
- **Purpose**: Detects blocked exhaust conditions
- **Failure Mode**: Heater shuts down if exhaust is blocked
- **Common Issues**: Bird nests, debris in exhaust stack

## Installation Verification Checklist

### Water Flow Verification
- Confirm minimum 40 GPM to the heater
- Check for restrictions in plumbing
- Verify filter is clean
- Ensure proper pipe sizing

### Electrical Supply Verification
- Use a voltmeter to confirm correct voltage
- 120V or 240V depending on model
- Check at main electrical terminal
- Verify proper grounding

### Gas Supply Verification
- Use a manometer connected to inlet side of gas valve
- Confirm correct gas pressure (inches of water column)
- Check for gas leaks with soap solution
- Verify gas type matches heater specifications (natural gas vs. propane)

### Safety Circuit Verification
- Test each safety switch for proper operation
- Verify all wiring connections are secure
- Check for corrosion at terminals
- Ensure proper safety switch sequence

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Heater Won't Ignite

| Check | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Pressure switch | Low water flow | Clean filter, check pump |
| High limit switch | Tripped due to overheat | Reset, check for cause |
| Air flow switch | Blocked ventilation | Clear vents, check blower |
| Gas valve | No gas supply | Check supply, valve position |
| Ignitor | Failed ignition | Test/replace ignitor |

### Heater Cycles On and Off

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Short cycles | Inadequate water flow | Increase flow, clean filter |
| Frequent trips | Oversized heater | Adjust settings, check sizing |
| Random shutoffs | Dirty flame sensor | Clean or replace sensor |

### Unusual Sounds

| Sound | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Rumbling | Scale buildup in exchanger | Descale heat exchanger |
| Whistling | Gas pressure issue | Adjust gas pressure |
| Banging | Delayed ignition | Clean burners, check ignition |

## Maintenance Schedule

### Weekly
- Visual inspection of venting
- Check for error codes
- Verify operation

### Monthly
- Clean around unit
- Check for debris in venting
- Inspect electrical connections

### Annually
- Professional inspection
- Clean burners and heat exchanger
- Test all safety switches
- Check gas connections
