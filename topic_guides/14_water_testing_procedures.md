# Water Testing Procedures (Taylor K2005)

## Pre-Test Assessment: The Four Senses

Before conducting any chemical tests, a professional technician performs an initial assessment using four of the five senses. This provides crucial context for the quantitative test results.

### Look
Visually inspect the water for clarity, color, and debris. Examine pool surfaces for any signs of discoloration, algae growth, or cracks.

### Listen
Pay close attention to the equipment pad. Note any unusual sounds from the pump, motor, or other components, such as grinding, squealing, or excessive noise.

### Smell
Be aware of any strong odors. An overwhelming chlorine smell often indicates a high level of combined chlorine (chloramines), not free chlorine.

### Feel
If you observe discoloration on a pool surface, carefully feel the area. This can help distinguish between algae (which may feel slimy) and a potential metal-based stain.

## Chlorine Testing (Free & Total)

1. Rinse the comparator tube and fill to the 9 mL mark
2. Add 5 drops of R-0870 (DPD Reagent #1)
3. Add 5 drops of R-0871 (DPD Reagent #2)
4. Cap and invert several times to mix
5. Compare the resulting pink/red color to the chlorine standards to get the Free Chlorine (FC) reading
6. To this same sample, add 5 drops of R-0003 (DPD Reagent #3)
7. Cap and invert to mix. The color may darken. This is the Total Chlorine (TC) reading
8. The difference between TC and FC is the Combined Chlorine (CC)

## pH Testing

1. Rinse the comparator tube and fill the large side to the 44 mL mark
2. Add 5 drops of R-0014 (Phenol Red Indicator)
3. Cap and invert to mix
4. Compare the resulting color to the pH standards
5. Ideal range is 7.4 to 7.6

## Total Alkalinity (TA) Testing

1. Rinse the large mixing bottle and fill to the 25 mL mark
2. Add 2 drops of R-0007 (Sulfuric Acid .12 N) to neutralize chlorine
3. Add 5 drops of R-0008 (Alkalinity Indicator). Swirl to mix. The water will turn green
4. Add R-0009 (Sulfuric Acid .12 N) drop by drop, swirling and counting each drop, until the solution turns from green to red
5. Multiply the total number of drops by 10 to get the Total Alkalinity (TA) in parts per million (ppm)
6. Example: 8 drops of R-0009 signifies a TA of 80 ppm

## Calcium Hardness (CH) Testing

1. Rinse the large mixing bottle and fill to the 25 mL mark
2. Add 20 drops of R-0010 (Hardness Reagent)
3. Add 5 drops of R-0011L (Calmagite Indicator). Swirl to mix. The water will turn red
4. Add R-0012 (Hardness Reagent) drop by drop, swirling and counting each drop, until the solution turns from red to a distinct sky blue
5. Note: Ignore any purple hues and look for the final blue color
6. Multiply the total number of drops by 10 to get the CH in ppm
7. Example: 43 drops = 430 ppm CH

## Cyanuric Acid (CYA) Testing

1. Rinse the small view tube and fill to the 7 mL mark
2. Add R-0013 (Melamine Reagent) up to the 14 mL mark
3. Cap and shake vigorously for 30 seconds. A cloudy precipitate will form
4. Let the sample stand for a moment, then slowly look down through the tube at the black dot on the bottom
5. Continue looking at the black dot as you view the measurement scale on the side of the tube
6. Stop when the black dot completely disappears
7. The reading at the water level is your CYA level in ppm

### CYA Reading Notes
- If the black dot remains visible even when the tube is full, the CYA level is below the minimum reading
- If the black dot disappears immediately upon mixing, the level is excessively high (over 100 ppm), which can impair chlorine's effectiveness

## Langelier Saturation Index (LSI)

The LSI is a comprehensive measure of the water's overall balance, determining whether it is corrosive, balanced, or scale-forming.

### Ideal LSI Range
-0.3 to +0.5

### Interpretation
- Positive number: water is trending towards being scale-forming
- Negative number: water is trending towards being corrosive
- Zero: perfectly balanced water

## Ideal Water Chemistry Ranges

| Parameter | Ideal Range |
|-----------|-------------|
| Free Chlorine | 1-3 ppm |
| pH | 7.4-7.6 |
| Total Alkalinity | 100-150 ppm |
| Calcium Hardness | 200-400 ppm |
| Cyanuric Acid | 30-50 ppm |
| Combined Chlorine | Below 0.5 ppm |
