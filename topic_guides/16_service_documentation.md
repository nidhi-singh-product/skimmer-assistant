# Service Documentation and Client Communication

## Why Documentation Matters

Documenting the service visit is not an administrative task—it is a core part of the professional service we provide. Diligent record-keeping protects the client's investment, protects the company from liability, and provides the essential data needed for effective long-term pool management.

## Standard Documentation Protocol

All data must be entered into the company's service software before leaving the property.

### Log All Chemical Readings
Enter the results from every water test performed:
- Chlorine (Free and Total)
- pH
- Total Alkalinity
- Calcium Hardness
- Cyanuric Acid (CYA)
- Any other parameters tested

### Log All Chemicals Added
Detail the exact type and quantity of every chemical added to the pool. Modern service software will use the logged readings and pool volume to auto-calculate the correct dosages required.

### Capture Photographic Proof
A minimum of two photos are required for every service visit:
1. One showing the clean and clear pool after service
2. One of the equipment pad showing the filter's pressure gauge (PSI) reading after the system has been serviced and is running

### Generate Service Report
Once all data and photos are entered, the software automatically generates and emails a digital service report to the client. This report provides:
- Transparent record of the visit
- Confirmation of work performed
- Builds customer trust

## Core Customer Expectations

Based on industry-wide analysis, today's clients have a clear set of expectations for premium pool service:

### Digital Communication and Photo Reports
Clients expect and value digital service reports that include photographic proof of a clean pool and properly functioning equipment.

### Consistency and Reliability
Customers demand:
- Consistent technician assignments
- Predictable service days
- Reliable time frames for their visits

### Clear Documentation
Every action taken, from chemical readings to chemicals added, must be clearly documented and communicated to the client after each visit.
