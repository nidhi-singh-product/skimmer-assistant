# Pool Opening - Spring Startup Procedures

## When to Open the Pool

Open the pool when daily high temperatures are consistently above 65-70°F. Opening too late risks algae growth in warm, untreated water.

**Regional Timing Guidelines:**
- Southern states (TX, FL, AZ): Late February to March
- Mid-Atlantic/Southeast: Mid-March to early April
- Northern states: Late April to May
- Wait until threat of hard freeze has passed

**Why timing matters:** Opening early while water is still cool makes the startup process easier. Warm, stagnant water grows algae quickly.

## Pre-Opening Inspection

Before touching the pool, walk the entire perimeter and check:

### Deck and Coping
- Cracks in concrete or pavers
- Loose or damaged coping stones
- Trip hazards
- Drainage issues

### Pool Structure
- Visible cracks in plaster, vinyl, or fiberglass
- Tile damage or missing grout
- Water level (should be mid-skimmer)
- Signs of leaks (wet spots around pool)

### Safety Equipment
- Fence gates close and latch properly
- Safety cover anchors intact (if applicable)
- Life ring and shepherd's hook present
- Pool alarm functional

## Step 1: Remove and Store the Cover

### For Solid Winter Covers
1. Use cover pump to remove standing water first
2. Use leaf blower or soft broom to clear debris
3. Have two people carefully remove cover, folding toward center
4. Avoid dragging debris into pool
5. Lay cover flat, hose off both sides
6. Allow to dry completely before storing
7. Fold and store in dry location

### For Mesh Safety Covers
1. Clear debris with leaf blower
2. Remove springs from anchors using cover tool
3. Fold cover carefully
4. Clean and dry before storing
5. Inspect for tears or worn straps

### For Automatic Covers
1. Clear debris from cover surface
2. Inspect track and mechanism
3. Test operation before retracting
4. Lubricate tracks if needed

**Important:** Inspect cover for damage. Repair or replace before next season if holes or tears are found.

## Step 2: Reinstall Equipment

### Return Winterizing Plugs to Storage
Remove all winterizing plugs from:
- Skimmer(s)
- Return jets
- Main drain (if plugged)
- Cleaner line (if applicable)
- Spa jets (if applicable)

### Reinstall Drain Plugs
Install drain plugs in:
- Pump housing (usually 2 plugs)
- Filter tank
- Heater
- Chlorinator
- Salt cell (if applicable)
- Booster pump (if applicable)

**Pro Tip:** Apply Teflon tape to threaded plugs and use pool lube on O-ring plugs.

### Reconnect Equipment
1. Reconnect pump to plumbing
2. Reinstall pressure gauge on filter
3. Reconnect heater plumbing
4. Install salt cell (if applicable)
5. Connect automation wiring
6. Reinstall return eyeballs (angle downward)

### Lubricate O-Rings and Gaskets
Apply pool-safe lubricant to:
- Pump lid O-ring
- Filter tank O-ring
- Chlorinator lid
- Union O-rings
- Valve O-rings

**Replace any O-rings that are cracked, flat, or worn.**

## Step 3: Reinstall Accessories

- Ladders and handrails (check anchor bolts)
- Diving board (if removed)
- Slide (check water supply connection)
- Skimmer baskets
- Skimmer weir doors
- Return eyeball fittings
- Cleaner and hose

## Step 4: Fill Pool to Proper Level

Water should reach the middle of the skimmer opening (halfway up).

### If Pool is Low
1. Insert garden hose into pool
2. Fill until water is mid-skimmer
3. Monitor to avoid overfilling
4. A typical residential pool gains about 1" per hour from garden hose

### If Pool is Overfilled
1. Set multiport valve to WASTE
2. Run pump to lower level
3. Or use submersible pump

## Step 5: Prime and Start the Pump

### Priming Procedure
1. Ensure all valves are open
2. Remove pump lid
3. Fill pump basket with water using garden hose
4. Reinstall lid and ensure O-ring is seated
5. Open air relief valve on filter
6. Turn on pump
7. Watch for prime (strainer basket fills with water)
8. Close air relief when steady stream of water emerges

### If Pump Won't Prime
- Check water level (most common issue)
- Check pump lid O-ring
- Check for closed valves
- Look for suction-side air leaks
- Ensure impeller is not clogged

## Step 6: Inspect for Leaks

With pump running, visually inspect:
- All pump connections
- Filter connections
- Heater connections
- Valve unions
- Underground pipe fittings (where visible)
- Equipment pad for puddling

**Any drips or sprays indicate a problem that needs correction before proceeding.**

## Step 7: Test Water Chemistry

Using a reliable test kit (Taylor K-2005 recommended), test:

| Parameter | Test For | Ideal Range |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Free Chlorine | Sanitizer level | 1-3 ppm |
| pH | Acidity/alkalinity | 7.4-7.6 |
| Total Alkalinity | pH buffer | 80-120 ppm |
| Calcium Hardness | Scaling potential | 200-400 ppm |
| Cyanuric Acid | Chlorine stabilizer | 30-50 ppm |

**Most important for opening:** pH and alkalinity must be balanced BEFORE adding chlorine or shock.

## Step 8: Balance Water Chemistry

### Adjustment Order
Always adjust in this sequence:
1. Total Alkalinity first
2. pH second
3. Calcium Hardness third
4. Stabilizer fourth
5. Sanitizer last

### Common Opening Adjustments

**Low pH:** Add soda ash (sodium carbonate)
**High pH:** Add muriatic acid or dry acid
**Low Alkalinity:** Add baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)
**Low Calcium:** Add calcium chloride
**Low Stabilizer:** Add cyanuric acid

Allow 4-6 hours between adjustments. Retest before adding more chemicals.

## Step 9: Shock the Pool

Spring opening requires a heavy shock treatment to kill any bacteria or algae spores.

### Shock Dosage for Opening
- Clear water: 1-2 lbs shock per 10,000 gallons
- Slightly green/cloudy: 2-3 lbs per 10,000 gallons
- Green water: 3-4 lbs per 10,000 gallons

### Shock Procedure
1. Apply shock in evening (after sunset)
2. Broadcast around pool perimeter
3. Brush pool thoroughly
4. Run pump for 24 hours minimum
5. Do not cover pool

### After Shocking
- Chlorine level will be very high (10+ ppm)
- Do not swim until chlorine drops below 5 ppm
- Usually 24-48 hours
- Retest before allowing swimming

## Step 10: Clean the Pool

### Brushing
1. Brush walls from tile line to floor
2. Brush behind ladders and in corners
3. Brush steps thoroughly
4. Push debris toward main drain

### Skimming
- Remove all floating debris
- Empty skimmer basket frequently during opening

### Vacuuming
**If water is clear:** Vacuum to filter
**If water is green/dirty:** Vacuum to waste to avoid clogging filter

## Step 11: Clean or Backwash Filter

After initial vacuuming and with pump running:

### Sand Filter
1. Turn off pump
2. Set valve to BACKWASH
3. Turn on pump for 2-3 minutes (until sight glass runs clear)
4. Turn off pump
5. Set valve to RINSE
6. Run for 30 seconds
7. Return to FILTER

### DE Filter
1. Backwash if equipped with multiport valve
2. Add fresh DE through skimmer (follow manufacturer specs)
3. Consider full breakdown cleaning if hasn't been done recently

### Cartridge Filter
1. Remove cartridge(s)
2. Hose off thoroughly
3. Soak in filter cleaner if needed
4. Reinstall
5. Consider replacement if more than 2 years old

## Step 12: Start Up Heater (If Applicable)

### Pre-Start Checklist
- Gas valve open
- Water flowing through heater (pump running)
- Filter pressure normal
- All valves open

### Startup Procedure
1. Turn on heater
2. Listen for ignition
3. Check for error codes
4. Feel return line for warming water
5. Monitor for 15-20 minutes

### If Heater Won't Fire
- Check gas supply
- Clean igniter
- Verify water flow
- Check pressure switch
- Call for service if problems persist

## Step 13: Final Checks and Documentation

### 24-Hour Retest
After pump has run 24 hours, retest all chemistry and adjust as needed.

### Document Opening
Record in service notes:
- Date opened
- Opening chemical readings
- Chemicals added
- Equipment condition
- Any issues found
- Recommendations for customer

### Communicate with Customer
- Explain what was done
- Note any concerns
- Provide waiting period before swimming
- Schedule follow-up visit if needed

## Opening Troubleshooting

### Water is Green Despite Shocking
- pH may have been too high (chlorine ineffective)
- Not enough shock added
- Filter may be clogged
- Solution: Rebalance pH, shock again, run pump 24/7

### Pump Loses Prime Overnight
- Air leak on suction side
- Low water level
- Faulty check valve
- Solution: Systematic leak detection

### Heater Error Codes at Startup
- Common after sitting idle
- Check flow and pressure switches first
- May need professional service

### Cloudy Water After Opening
- Dead algae (normal after shocking)
- Run filter continuously
- Add clarifier if needed
- Vacuum to waste if severe
