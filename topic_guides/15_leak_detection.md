# Pool Leak Detection and Repair Guide

## Overview
Leak detection is a critical skill for pool service technicians. This guide covers systematic approaches to identify, locate, and repair pool leaks, from initial verification through repair techniques.

## 1. Initial Verification: Is it a Leak?

### Evaporation vs. Leak
Before deploying advanced equipment, verify the leak exists and is not merely evaporation. Normal evaporation can account for up to 3.5 inches of water loss per week depending on humidity, wind, and temperature.

### The Bucket Test
This is the industry standard for confirming a leak.

**Procedure:**
1. **Setup**: Fill a 5-gallon bucket with pool water and place it on the second step of the pool (partially submerged) to keep the temperature consistent
2. **Match Levels**: Fill the bucket until the water level inside matches the pool water level outside
3. **Mark**: Use electrical tape or a waterproof marker to mark the water level on the inside and outside of the bucket
4. **Wait**: Turn off the pump and auto-fill. Wait 24 hours
5. **Analyze**:
   - **Evaporation**: If both levels drop the same amount, it is evaporation
   - **Leak**: If the pool water level drops more than the bucket level, there is a leak

## 2. Isolation Strategy: Narrowing the Search

Determine if the leak is in the plumbing (pressure/suction) or the structure (shell/fittings).

### Pump On vs. Pump Off Test
Mark the water level and run the pool for 24 hours, then mark it again and leave the system off for 24 hours. Compare the results:

| Condition | Likely Leak Location |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Loses **more** water when system is **ON** | Pressure side leak (return lines) |
| Loses **more** water when system is **OFF** | Suction side leak (skimmer/main drain lines) |
| Water loss is the **same** regardless | Structural leak (liner, light niche, shell cracks) |

## 3. Leak Identification Techniques

### The Dye Test
Used to visually confirm a leak location in the shell or fittings.

- **Preparation**: Turn off the pump to ensure the water is completely still and calm
- **Technique**: Using a syringe, gently squirt a small ribbon of dye near suspected areas (cracks, fittings, light niches)
- **Observation**: If there is a leak, the dye will be physically sucked into the hole or crack rather than dissipating into the water
- **Pro Tip**: Do not dump large amounts of dye into the pool; it must be applied locally and precisely

### Pressure Testing Plumbing
Used to test the integrity of underground pipes.

**Procedure:**
1. **Plug the Lines**: Use expansion plugs to block all returns and skimmer lines in the pool
2. **Induce Pressure**: Use a pressure testing rig attached to a garden hose or compressor to introduce water/air into the line
3. **The Standard**: Pressurize the line to **15-20 PSI**. Close the valve and watch the gauge
   - **Holding**: If the needle stays steady for 1-2 minutes, the line is good
   - **Dropping**: If the pressure drops, there is a leak in that section of plumbing
4. **Principles**: Water does not compress, so a water test will show a rapid pressure drop if there is a leak. Air compresses, so a line with a lot of air will show a slower pressure drop

### Sonic/Listening Detection
If a line fails the pressure test, use a listening device (geophone/hydrophone) to pinpoint the break underground.

- **Method**: Inject air and water into the leaking line. As air escapes the pipe into water-saturated soil, it makes a distinct "bubbling" or "gurgling" sound
- **Execution**: Use a listening device along the path of the plumbing (through the deck or soil) to locate the sound

## 4. Common Leak Locations & Troubleshooting

### Skimmers
- **The Throat**: A common leak point is where the plastic skimmer throat meets the pool tile or wall. Use dye to check the corners
- **The Housing**: Look for horizontal cracks inside the skimmer housing, often caused by sinking decks or ground settling putting stress on the plastic
- **Troubleshooting**: Plug the skimmer line at the bottom. If the pool stops leaking, the issue is in the underground skimmer line

### Pool Lights
- **Symptoms**: If the water level drops and stops exactly at the level of the light, the leak is likely there
- **Conduit**: The conduit (pipe) behind the light niche can break or separate
- **Fix**: You can use a temporary putty, or for a permanent fix, use a split conduit plug (like a cord stopper) with sealant where the cord enters the conduit

### Main Drain
- **Hydrostatic Valve**: Located at the bottom of the drain sump. If debris (rocks/sticks) gets stuck in it, it may stay open, draining the pool. Check that the O-ring seal is good
- **Testing**: This requires diving. Remove the main drain cover and plug the pipe. If the water level holds the next day, the leak is in the drain line

### Vinyl Liners
- **Pinholes**: Inspect corners where the liner stretches from the floor to the wall. Sand granules behind the liner can poke through
- **Seams**: Check seams for separation
- **Detection**: You must swim the pool with a mask. Do not rely on dumping dye; you must visually spot the hole or divot first, then verify with dye

### Structural Cracks
- **Spillways**: In pool/spa combos, check the spillway for cracks, as this is a high-stress area
- **Fitting Interfaces**: Check around return fittings and suction grates where plaster meets the plastic/metal. Gaps often open up here

## 5. Equipment Checklist for Technicians

| Equipment | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Pressure Testing Rig** | Manifold with gauges and valves for air/water input |
| **Closed Stem Plugs** | To block lines |
| **Open Stem/Injector Plugs** | To introduce pressure |
| **Inflatable Plugs** | For odd-sized or out-of-round pipes |
| **Hook Plugs** | For return fittings to seal past the threads |
| **Dye Testing Kit** | Syringes with blue or fluorescent yellow dye |
| **Compressor** | Small air compressor for inducing air into lines |
| **Listening Device** | Amplifier with headphones and a ground microphone |
| **Diving Gear** | Mask, snorkel, and weights to stay on the bottom while searching |

## 6. Repair Techniques

### Epoxy / Pool Putty
- **Usage**: For structural cracks, skimmer throats, and main drain casings
- **Technique**: Mix the two-part epoxy (resin and hardener) until it is a uniform color (white/gray). Pack it tightly into the crack or hole to ensure a bond, then smooth it out

### Vinyl Patching
- **Material**: Use a piece of actual liner material if available; it is stronger than clear plastic patches. Cut the patch in a circle (no corners to lift)
- **Application**: Apply vinyl glue to the patch, fold it in half (glue side in) to take it underwater, unfold it at the leak site, and press firmly

### The "Bread Trick" for Plumbing
- **Scenario**: When repairing a pipe below water level where water keeps trickling out, preventing a good glue joint
- **Technique**: Stuff white bread into the pipe upstream of the cut. It stops the water flow long enough to glue the fitting. The bread will dissolve and blow out of the return jets once the system is turned back on

## 7. When to Refer to Specialists

While a service tech can handle many leaks, refer to a dedicated Leak Detection Specialist when:

- **Underground Precision is Required**: If a pressure test fails but you cannot locate the break with a listening device, specialists have advanced gas tracing and helium equipment
- **Major Structural Damage**: Large cracks in the gunite shell or beam often require stapling and major construction work
- **Complex Skimmer Replacements**: If a skimmer needs to be dug out of a concrete deck, this is often a construction job rather than a service job

## Quick Reference: Leak Detection Decision Tree

```
Pool Losing Water?
    │
    ├── Do Bucket Test
    │       │
    │       ├── Both drop equally → Evaporation (not a leak)
    │       │
    │       └── Pool drops more → Confirmed leak, continue
    │
    └── Pump On vs Off Test
            │
            ├── More loss with pump ON → Check return lines (pressure test)
            │
            ├── More loss with pump OFF → Check skimmer/main drain lines
            │
            └── Same loss either way → Check structure (dye test fittings, lights, cracks)
```
