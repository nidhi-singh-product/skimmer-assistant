# Pool Cleaners Guide for Service Technicians

## Overview
This guide covers types of pool cleaners, common brands, installation procedures, troubleshooting, and maintenance tips for pool service technicians.

## 1. Types of Pool Cleaners

### Suction-Side Cleaners
Connect directly to the skimmer or a dedicated suction line, using the main pool pump for power.

- **Mechanism**: Moves around the pool as the pump sucks water through it
- **Best Application**: Screened-in pools or environments with lighter debris (sand, silt)
- **Key Brands**: Hayward (Navigator), Zodiac
- **Note**: Heavy debris can clog the basket or filter quickly, reducing circulation

### Pressure-Side Cleaners
Use water pressure from the return line or a dedicated booster pump.

- **Mechanism**: Water pressure drives wheels and creates suction through a debris bag
- **Best Application**: Pools with heavy debris (leaves, acorns, twigs)
- **Key Brands**: Polaris (most common)
- **Note**: Requires a booster pump for most models (280, 380, Quattro Sport)

### Robotic Cleaners
Independent electric cleaners that run on low voltage and have their own filtration canisters.

- **Mechanism**: Plug into an outlet; do not rely on the pool's pump or filter
- **Best Application**: Pools with heavy debris loads where independent filtration is desired to save the main filter
- **Key Brands**: Polaris, Dolphin, Maytronics

### In-Floor Cleaning Systems
Built-in systems with pop-up heads in the pool floor.

- **Mechanism**: Pop-up heads on the pool floor rise in zones (like a sprinkler system) to push debris toward a main drain
- **Key Brands**: A&A, Paramount, Blue Square

### Professional Service Vacuums (Battery/Manual)
- **Riptide / Hammerhead / PowerVac**: Battery-powered vacuums used by technicians for route stops. They use a bag system to capture large debris (leaves/sticks) without clogging the truck's vacuum hose
- **Pool Blaster Pro**: Generally considered less effective for professional route work due to lack of weight and power

## 2. Pressure-Side Cleaner: Polaris 280 & 380

### Troubleshooting Common Problems

**Cleaner Spinning in Circles**
- **Cause**: Worn-out tires or drive mechanism issues. If one wheel turns but the other doesn't, the cleaner will circle
- **Fix**: Replace the tires (rubber wears down) or inspect the internal drive teeth

**Cleaner Floating/Tipping**
- **Cause**: The "head float" (on the back of the unit) has cracked and filled with water
- **Fix**: Remove the old float and push a new one onto the feed pipe

**Tail Spraying Out of Pool**
- **Fix**: Adjust the tail sweep screw (located on the back) to reduce water flow to the tail

**Backup Valve Stuck (Spraying Constantly)**
- **Symptoms**: The cleaner lifts off the floor and sprays water continuously from the backup valve without cycling
- **Fix**: The internal gearbox is stripped or the case is cracked

### Repair Procedures

**Backup Valve Replacement (Cost-Saving Tip)**
- Instead of buying the entire $80+ backup valve assembly, you can often replace just the outer shell if the internal gears are fine but the casing is cracked
- **Installation**: Ensure the "acorn" tip points *toward* the cleaner

**Thrust Jet Adjustment**
- Located on the back of the cleaner. Loosen the two screws to adjust the jet direction
- **11 o'clock position**: Helps the cleaner climb better
- **1 o'clock position**: Keeps the cleaner lower

**Hose Maintenance**
- Ensure the hose length is sufficient to reach the furthest point plus a few feet, but not so long it tangles
- If the hose tangles often, verify the swivels are functioning. You can cut the hose and add extra swivels if necessary

## 3. Pressure-Side Cleaner: Polaris Quattro Sport / P40

### Troubleshooting "Not Moving"

1. **Check the Basics**: Ensure the booster pump is running and the inline screen (in the wall fitting) is clear of debris

2. **Pressure Relief Valve**: Check the pressure relief valve on the wall fitting. If it is cracked or stuck open, the cleaner won't get enough pressure to move

3. **Wheel Wobble**: Wobbly wheels indicate worn bearings. There are two bearings per wheel (8 total). If they fall out or seize, the cleaner stops

### Rebuild & Repair Steps

**Accessing Internals**
- Remove the 4 screws holding the top cover (two near the handle, two near the front)

**Gearbox Assembly**
- This is the "engine" and a common failure point
- If the cleaner isn't moving but water is flowing, the gearbox likely needs replacement
- It is a modular part that slides out

**Drive Shaft**
- Located under the cover. Check the teeth on the shaft
- If worn smooth, they won't engage the wheels
- Held in by 8 screws

**Water Management System (Venturi Test)**
- Remove the manifold (clips in)
- Use a garden hose to flush the venturi jets and a paperclip to clear debris
- If these are clogged, the cleaner won't stick to the floor or climb

**Belts/Tracks**
- If the rubber tracks are worn smooth, they can simply be pulled off and new ones slid onto the wheels without tools

## 4. Robotic Cleaner: Polaris P965IQ / 9550

### Troubleshooting Error 10 (Communication Error)
This error indicates the control box cannot "talk" to the motor block.

**Step 1: Clean the Pins**
- The cable connector pins often get oxidized
- Roll up a small piece of sandpaper and gently sand the pins on the cable connector

**Step 2: Check Swivel Connections**
- Unscrew the nut on the cable swivel
- Slide back the casing to reveal the internal wires
- Check the hex screws holding the wires into the pins
- A loose wire here causes intermittent connection failures
- Tighten with a small hex key

## 5. In-Floor Cleaning Systems

### Troubleshooting

**Heads Not Retracting/Rotating**
- If a head stays up, physically inspect it for debris
- If it moves up and down but doesn't rotate to a new position, the internal gear mechanism is bad and the head must be replaced

**Zone Failure**
- If only one zone (group of heads) works continuously, or one zone never fires, the issue is the **water valve** (the "brain" at the equipment pad)
- **Repair**: Open the water valve band clamp. Inspect the turbine and gear cassette. If the turbine spins but gears don't turn, replace the gear module

**Low Performance** (heads pop up weakly)
Check for flow restrictions:
- Dirty filter (backwash/clean cartridges)
- Heater bypass closed (heaters restrict flow; opening the bypass can increase pressure to the floor)
- Open water features (diverting water away from the floor system)

## 6. Service Tech Equipment (Riptide / Hammerhead)

### Riptide Maintenance & Troubleshooting

**Breaker Tripping** (vacuum turns off immediately upon entering water)

- **Check the Propeller**: Hair or palm frond strings wrapped under the prop create resistance, tripping the breaker. Remove the prop and clean the shaft
- **Check the Breaker Button**: Ensure the breaker button is pushed *all* the way in until it clicks
- **Check Connections**: Use a wire brush to clean corrosion off the power cord plug and the switch box terminals
