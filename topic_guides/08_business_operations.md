## 1. How to Bid on Pools

### Pre-Bid Assessment

**Information to Gather:**
- Pool size (gallons)
- Pool type (gunite, vinyl, fiberglass)
- Equipment inventory (pump, filter, heater, salt system, etc.)
- Current condition
- Special features (spa, water features, automation)
- Access (gate codes, locked areas)
- Customer expectations

**Site Visit Checklist:**
- [ ] Measure or estimate pool volume
- [ ] Note equipment age and condition
- [ ] Identify potential problem areas
- [ ] Assess accessibility
- [ ] Evaluate landscape impact (trees, debris)
- [ ] Estimate chemical needs
- [ ] Note drive time from route

### Calculating Your Costs

**Direct Costs Per Stop:**
| Cost Category | Typical Range | Your Cost |
|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| Chemicals | $15-30/month | ___ |
| Labor (your time) | $25-50/hour | ___ |
| Drive time | $10-20/stop | ___ |
| Equipment wear | $5-10/stop | ___ |
| Insurance/overhead | $10-15/stop | ___ |

**Time Estimate:**
- Basic service: 20-30 minutes
- Large pool: 30-45 minutes
- Problem pool: 45-60+ minutes
- Add drive time

### Pricing Strategies

**Formula Approach:**
```
Monthly Price = (Time × Hourly Rate) + Chemicals + Drive Cost + Overhead + Profit Margin
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Time: 30 min = 0.5 hours × $40/hour = $20
- Chemicals: $25/month average
- Drive: $15
- Overhead: $10
- Subtotal: $70
- 20% profit margin: $14
- **Monthly bid: $84**

**Market-Based Approach:**
- Research local competitors
- Know your market's price range
- Position based on your service level
- Don't race to the bottom

### Common Bidding Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Underpricing**
- Competing on price alone
- Not accounting for all costs
- Ignoring difficult conditions
**Solution:** Know your numbers, value your time

**Mistake 2: Not Walking the Property**
- Missing equipment issues
- Underestimating debris
- Overlooking access problems
**Solution:** Always do site visit before bidding

**Mistake 3: One-Size-Fits-All Pricing**
- Same price for easy and hard pools
- Not adjusting for pool condition
- Ignoring chemical demand
**Solution:** Price each pool individually

**Mistake 4: Not Including Extras**
- Forgetting filter cleans
- Not pricing equipment repairs
- Free emergency visits
**Solution:** Create comprehensive service agreement

## 2. Are You Charging Enough?

### Signs You're Undercharging
- Working more, earning less
- No profit after expenses
- Can't afford quality equipment
- No money for marketing
- Dread difficult pools
- High stress, low satisfaction

### Know Your Numbers

**Calculate Your True Hourly Rate:**
```
Monthly Revenue ÷ Hours Worked = Effective Hourly Rate
```

**Example:**
- Monthly revenue: $6,000
- Hours worked: 180
- Effective rate: $33/hour

**Is that enough?** Consider:
- Self-employment tax (15.3%)
- Health insurance
- Vehicle expenses
- Equipment replacement
- Vacation/sick time
- Retirement savings

### Raising Your Prices

**When to Raise:**
- Annually at minimum
- When costs increase
- When demand exceeds capacity
- When taking on difficult pools

**How to Raise:**
1. Notify customers 30+ days in advance
2. Explain value you provide
3. Offer options if appropriate
4. Be confident - you're worth it
5. Expect some pushback - that's okay

**Communication Example:**
"Due to increased operating costs, rates will increase by $X effective [date]. We appreciate your continued business and remain committed to keeping your pool in excellent condition."

### Value-Based Pricing

**What You Actually Provide:**
- Peace of mind
- Time savings for customer
- Expertise and problem-solving
- Equipment protection
- Liability coverage
- Consistent, reliable service

**Price for value, not just time.**
