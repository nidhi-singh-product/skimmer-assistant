## 2. Skimming and Surface Cleaning

### Proper Skimming Technique
1. Start from downwind side (debris collects there)
2. Use slow, steady strokes
3. Keep net at surface level, not submerged
4. Work systematically around pool
5. Empty net frequently to maintain effectiveness

### Skimmer Basket Maintenance
- Empty every visit
- Check for cracks or damage
- Ensure basket seats properly
- Consider skimmer socks for fine debris

### Common Surface Debris
| Debris Type | Best Removal | Prevention |
|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Leaves | Leaf net | Tree trimming |
| Insects | Fine mesh net | Bug zappers |
| Pollen | Skim + shock | Filter running longer |
| Oil/sunscreen | Enzyme product | Scum balls |

## 3. Brushing Techniques

### Why Brushing Matters
- Prevents algae attachment
- Removes biofilm
- Distributes chemicals
- Keeps surfaces looking clean
- Reduces chemical usage over time

### Brush Types
| Brush Type | Best For | Avoid On |
|------------|----------|----------|
| Nylon/Plastic | Vinyl, fiberglass | - |
| Stainless Steel | Gunite, plaster, concrete | Vinyl, fiberglass |
| Combo (nylon edges) | Plaster with vinyl steps | - |

### Brushing Procedure
1. Start at shallow end
2. Work brush toward main drain
3. Overlap strokes
4. Pay attention to:
   - Corners and crevices
   - Behind ladders
   - Steps and benches
   - Tile line
   - Water line
5. Brush bottom toward drain
6. Let debris settle, then vacuum

### Frequency
- Gunite/plaster: Weekly minimum
- Vinyl/fiberglass: Weekly (gentler)
- Problem areas: 2-3x per week
- During algae treatment: Daily

## 4. Vacuuming

### Vacuum Methods

**Manual Vacuum (Suction Side)**
- Connects to skimmer or dedicated vacuum port
- Uses pump suction for power
- Good for: targeted cleaning, heavier debris

**Pressure-Side Cleaner**
- Uses return water pressure
- Has its own debris bag
- Good for: daily maintenance, leaves

**Robotic Cleaner**
- Self-contained, runs independently
- Cleans floor, walls, waterline
- Good for: thorough cleaning, energy savings

### Manual Vacuum Procedure

**Setup:**
1. Attach vacuum head to pole
2. Connect hose to vacuum head
3. Submerge head and hose
4. Fill hose with water (hold at return jet)
5. Cover skimmer basket with vacuum plate (or use dedicated port)
6. Insert hose into skimmer/port

**Vacuuming:**
1. Move slowly - rushing stirs up debris
2. Overlap strokes (like mowing lawn)
3. Keep head on floor (lifting loses prime)
4. Work toward main drain
5. If losing suction, check strainer basket

**Vacuum to Waste (Bypass Filter):**
Use when:
- Vacuuming large debris
- After algae treatment (dead algae)
- Heavy contamination
- Flocking (flocculant treatment)

Procedure:
1. Set multiport to WASTE
2. Refill pool while vacuuming
3. Watch water level
4. May need to refill and resume

## 5. Tile and Waterline Cleaning

### Calcium Scale
**Cause:** High calcium + high pH
**Appearance:** White, crusty deposits
**Removal:**
- Pumice stone (on tile/plaster only, NOT vinyl)
- Tile cleaner (commercial products)
- Muriatic acid solution (1:10, careful on grout)
- Prevention: Maintain proper chemistry

### Scum Line (Oils/Lotions)
**Cause:** Body oils, sunscreen, cosmetics
**Appearance:** Gray/brown ring at waterline
**Removal:**
- Tile and vinyl cleaner
- Enzyme products
- Magic eraser (gentle)
- Prevention: Scum absorbers, enzyme products

### Metal Staining
**Cause:** Copper, iron in water
**Appearance:** Green (copper), brown/rust (iron)
**Removal:**
- Metal stain remover (ascorbic acid)
- Sequestering agent
- Prevention: Metal sequestrant regularly

### Cleaning Tips
- Clean tile every visit (prevents buildup)
- Use appropriate cleaner for surface type
- Never use household cleaners (foaming, chemicals)
- Scrub with non-abrasive pad on vinyl
- Pumice okay on plaster tile, NOT glazed tile

---

## 6. Filter Maintenance

### Backwash Timing (Sand/DE)
- When pressure rises 8-10 PSI above clean baseline
- After vacuuming heavy debris
- After algae treatment
- Minimum: every 4-6 weeks even if pressure normal

### Cartridge Cleaning Schedule
- Light use: Every 2-4 weeks
- Heavy use: Weekly
- Deep clean: Monthly (soak in cleaner)

### Filter Pressure Log
Record clean baseline pressure and track over time:
| Date | Pressure | Action Taken |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 1/1 | 12 PSI | Baseline after cleaning |
| 1/15 | 18 PSI | Backwashed |
| 1/29 | 21 PSI | Backwashed |

## 7. Seasonal Maintenance

### Spring Opening Procedure
1. Remove cover, clean and store
2. Refill pool to proper level
3. Remove winterizing plugs
4. Reinstall drain plugs, pressure gauge
5. Prime and start pump
6. Clean filter thoroughly
7. Test and balance chemistry
8. Shock pool
9. Run pump 24 hours
10. Vacuum debris
11. Inspect all equipment

### Fall Closing Procedure (Cold Climates)
1. Balance chemistry
2. Shock and add algaecide
3. Clean pool thoroughly
4. Lower water level (below skimmer or per local practice)
5. Drain equipment (pump, filter, heater, chlorinator)
6. Add antifreeze to lines
7. Install winterizing plugs
8. Cover pool
9. Document equipment settings

### Off-Season Maintenance (Warm Climates)
- Reduce service frequency
- Lower pump run time
- Maintain minimum chemistry
- Continue filter maintenance
- Watch for algae (reduced chlorine demand)
