# Common Callbacks - Prevention and Resolution Guide

## What is a Callback?

A callback occurs when a customer contacts you after a service visit because the problem wasn't resolved or a new issue appeared. Callbacks cost time, money, and can damage customer relationships. Understanding the most common callback reasons helps technicians prevent them.

**Industry Average:** 5-10% callback rate is typical. Elite service companies target under 3%.

## Green Pool Returns Within 48 Hours

### Why It Happens
- Insufficient chlorine added during initial treatment
- Failed to address phosphates (algae food source)
- Pump run time not increased after treatment
- Filter not cleaned after killing algae
- Cyanuric acid too high (chlorine ineffective)

### Prevention Checklist
1. **Test CYA levels first** - If over 100 ppm, recommend partial drain
2. **Calculate chlorine needed** - Use 30 ppm shock dose for heavy algae
3. **Add algaecide** - Polyquat 60 after chlorine level drops below 5 ppm
4. **Treat phosphates** - If over 500 ppb, add phosphate remover
5. **Clean filter** - Backwash or clean cartridge 24-48 hours after treatment
6. **Instruct homeowner** - Run pump 24 hours for 3-4 days

### Resolution Steps
1. Re-test water chemistry completely
2. Check CYA level (often the hidden culprit)
3. Brush pool thoroughly (break up remaining algae)
4. Shock again with proper dosage
5. Add algaecide if not done previously
6. Schedule follow-up visit in 48 hours

## Cloudy Water After Service

### Why It Happens
- Filter not running long enough
- High calcium hardness (scale formation)
- Imbalanced pH affecting chlorine efficacy
- Air in system creating micro-bubbles
- Filter media exhausted

### Prevention Checklist
1. **Verify filter pressure** - Note starting vs ending pressure
2. **Check filter media age** - Sand (5-7 years), DE grids (7-10 years), Cartridges (1-2 years)
3. **Balance calcium** - Target 200-400 ppm
4. **Confirm pump runtime** - Minimum 8 hours daily
5. **Check returns** - Ensure proper circulation patterns

### Resolution Steps
1. Run pump continuously for 24 hours
2. Add clarifier if not recently used
3. Check filter - clean or replace if needed
4. Test and balance calcium hardness
5. Verify no air leaks on suction side

## Salt Cell "Low Salt" After Adding Salt

### Why It Happens
- Salt not fully dissolved (takes 24-48 hours)
- Added salt directly over cell (temporarily high reading)
- Cell needs calibration after salt addition
- Cell dirty affecting conductivity reading
- Incorrect salt type used (contains additives)

### Prevention Checklist
1. **Add salt away from skimmer** - Spread around shallow end
2. **Brush salt** - Help dissolution process
3. **Wait to retest** - Inform customer salt takes 24 hours to dissolve
4. **Check cell condition** - Clean before leaving if scaled
5. **Use proper salt** - Pool salt or water softener salt (no additives)

### Resolution Steps
1. Manually test salt level (don't rely on cell reading)
2. If salt is correct, recalibrate cell per manufacturer instructions
3. Clean cell with diluted muriatic acid (4:1 water to acid)
4. Check cell for visible damage or heavy scaling
5. If cell is 3-5 years old, may need replacement

## Equipment Running When It Shouldn't

### Why It Happens
- Timer or automation schedule changed accidentally
- Override mode left on
- Freeze protection activated (normal in cold weather)
- Wiring issue from recent work
- Automation lost programming

### Prevention Checklist
1. **Document schedules** before service
2. **Reset any overrides** after testing equipment
3. **Check automation mode** - Should show "Auto" not "Manual"
4. **Note freeze protect settings** - Explain to customer
5. **Test schedule** - Verify equipment turns off at expected time

### Resolution Steps
1. Check automation system for manual overrides
2. Review schedule programming
3. Check for freeze protection activation
4. Reset automation to default schedule if needed
5. Look for stuck relays if automation shows off but equipment runs

## Water Level Problems

### Why It Happens
- Auto-fill stuck on or off
- Leak not identified during visit
- Backwash valve left in wrong position
- Skimmer weir stuck
- Recent heavy rain (customer doesn't understand)

### Prevention Checklist
1. **Check auto-fill** - Test operation before leaving
2. **Note water level** - Document in service report
3. **Verify backwash valve** - Confirm in filter position
4. **Test skimmer weir** - Ensure it moves freely
5. **Inspect for obvious leaks** - Pump, filter, equipment pad

### Resolution Steps
1. Mark water level with tape, check after 24 hours
2. Perform bucket test (rule out evaporation)
3. Check auto-fill float and valve operation
4. Inspect backwash valve position
5. Look for wet spots around equipment
6. If leak suspected, schedule leak detection service

## Staining Appeared After Service

### Why It Happens
- Metal dropped chlorine without sequestrant
- pH swings caused scale deposits
- Organic stains from leaves/debris left on surface
- Improper chemical addition (dumping vs broadcasting)
- Copper algaecide overuse

### Prevention Checklist
1. **Test for metals** - Before adding oxidizers
2. **Add sequestrant** if metals present
3. **Brush organic debris** before treating
4. **Broadcast chemicals** - Never dump in one spot
5. **Use non-copper algaecides** - Polyquat 60 preferred

### Resolution Steps
1. Identify stain type:
   - Organic (tan/brown) = Chlorine treatment
   - Metal (green/blue/brown) = Ascorbic acid treatment
   - Scale (white) = pH reduction + brushing
2. Test for metals
3. Add appropriate stain remover
4. Brush affected areas
5. Add sequestrant after treatment

## Callback Prevention Best Practices

### Before Leaving Every Job

1. **Run all equipment** - Test pumps, heaters, cleaners, lights
2. **Check filter pressure** - Document reading
3. **Verify automation** - Test schedules and remote control
4. **Water test results** - Confirm chemicals balanced or treatment started
5. **Visual inspection** - Clear water, no visible issues
6. **Customer communication** - Explain any treatments and expectations

### Documentation Standards

- Take "before and after" photos
- Record all chemical additions and amounts
- Note equipment readings (pressure, salt level, etc.)
- Document any customer instructions given
- Flag potential issues for follow-up

### Communication Templates

**After algae treatment:**
"Your pool has been shocked for algae. Please run the pump 24 hours for the next 3 days. The water will look worse before it looks better. We'll check back in 48 hours."

**After adding salt:**
"Added [X] bags of salt. The cell may show low salt for 24-48 hours while it dissolves. If it still shows low after 2 days, please call us."

**After heater service:**
"Tested the heater - it's firing properly. If you notice any issues, first check that the pump has been running for at least 5 minutes before turning on the heater."
