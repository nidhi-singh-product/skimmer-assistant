# Seasonal Pool Care Guide

## Overview
Seasonal pool care varies dramatically based on climate and usage patterns. This guide provides comprehensive procedures for each season, helping service technicians deliver consistent, professional results year-round.

## 1. Spring Opening Procedures ("The Awakening")

### Timing the Opening

**The 70-Degree Rule**
- Plan to open the pool when daytime temperatures consistently stay above **70°F (21°C)**
- Opening too late allows algae to bloom as the water warms
- Opening too early in freezing climates requires running the pump overnight to prevent freezing

**Pollen Strategy**
- In areas with heavy pollen, it is often best to open *before* the major pollen drop
- This allows the filtration system to capture pollen rather than letting it accumulate in stagnant water

### Cover Management

**Solid Covers**
- Pump off standing water and remove debris before taking the cover off to prevent dirty water from falling into the pool
- Clean the cover with car wash soap or cover cleaner
- Rinse and let it dry completely before storage to prevent mold/mildew

**Mesh Covers**
- These allow sunlight and fine debris through
- Expect algae growth if opened late in the season

### Equipment Reassembly

1. **Plugs and Fittings**: Reinstall drain plugs on the pump, filter, heater, and chlorinator. Use Teflon tape or plumber's tape on threaded connections to ensure a watertight seal
2. **Pressure Gauge**: Install a fresh gauge if the old one is stuck or unreadable
3. **Pump Priming**: Fill the pump basket with water before starting to help it prime
4. **Inspection**: Check all O-rings and gaskets; replace if cracked or flattened

### Start-Up Water Chemistry

Balance chemistry in this specific order:

| Step | Parameter | Target | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Shock Treatment | Based on water color | Green: 2-3 lbs/10K gal; Black/Swamp: Quadruple dose |
| 2 | Total Alkalinity (TA) | 80-120 ppm | Adjust first as it affects pH |
| 3 | pH | 7.4-7.6 | Adjusting alkalinity often affects pH |
| 4 | Sanitizer (Chlorine) | 1-3 ppm | Establish chlorine residual |
| 5 | Stabilizer (CYA) | 30-50 ppm | Add if necessary; Trichlor tabs add CYA over time |
| 6 | Calcium Hardness | 175-275 ppm | Adjust last to protect surfaces (varies by pool type) |

## 2. Summer Maintenance Schedules (The "Three C's")

Routine maintenance revolves into three categories: **Circulation, Cleaning, and Chemistry**

### A. Circulation & Equipment

**Pump Runtime**
- Run the pump at least **8 to 12 hours daily** during the summer
- In extreme heat (over 100°F), run it longer or 24/7
- The entire pool volume should turn over at least once per day

**Salt Cells**
- Inspect salt cells every **3 months**
- Remove calcium buildup using a hose or a mild acid wash (4:1 water-to-acid ratio) if scraping doesn't work

**Filter Maintenance**
- Monitor the pressure gauge weekly
- Backwash or clean the filter when the pressure rises **8-10 PSI above the clean starting pressure**
- *Technician Tip*: Do not backwash too frequently; a slightly dirty filter traps finer particles better than a perfectly clean one

### B. Cleaning Routine

| Task | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Skim surface debris | Daily or every other day | Prevents sinking and staining the floor |
| Brush walls and floor | Weekly | Focus on waterline, steps, and corners |
| Vacuum | Weekly | Use automatic cleaner or manual vacuum |
| Clean skimmer baskets | 2-3x per week | More often during heavy debris periods |
| Empty pump basket | Weekly | Check for clogs affecting flow |

### C. Chemistry Maintenance

**Weekly Testing Schedule**
- pH and chlorine: 2-3 times per week (daily during heat waves)
- Total alkalinity: Weekly
- CYA and calcium: Monthly

**Saltwater Pools**
- pH naturally rises in salt pools
- Expect to add acid frequently to keep pH below 7.8
- Check salt levels monthly (target: 2700-3400 ppm)

**Summer Chemical Challenges**
- High bather loads increase chlorine demand
- Heavy rain dilutes chemicals and introduces contaminants
- Intense sun degrades chlorine faster—maintain adequate CYA levels

## 3. Fall Closing & Winterization ("The Shutdown")

### Timing

Wait until the water temperature is consistently **below 65°F (18°C)**
- Closing too early (when water is warm) promotes algae growth under the cover

### Preparation

1. **Deep Clean**: Brush and vacuum thoroughly. Debris left in the pool will stain the liner and consume chemicals all winter

2. **Final Shock**: Add a double dose of chlorine shock 2-3 days *before* closing to allow chlorine levels to normalize slightly before adding winter algaecide

3. **Winter Chemicals**: Add a **Winter Pill** (enzymes/clarifier) and a **Polyquat 60 Algaecide**. Avoid copper-based algaecides if you are worried about staining

### Plumbing & Equipment (In-Ground)

1. **Lower Water Level**: Drain water below the skimmer and return jets

2. **Blow Out Lines**: Use an air compressor or Cyclone blower to force water out of the suction and return lines. This is critical in freezing climates to prevent burst pipes

3. **Plugs & Gizzmos**: Install rubber expansion plugs in returns. Install a **Gizzmo** in the skimmer to absorb ice expansion and prevent the skimmer housing from cracking

4. **Salt Cells**: Remove the cell and store it indoors. Install a "dummy cell" or pipe spacer in its place

### Above Ground Pools

- Lower water level below the return fitting
- Disconnect and drain the pump, filter, and hoses
- Store equipment indoors if possible
- Use a cable and winch system for winter covers
- Install an air pillow under the cover to prevent ice damage and allow rain/snow runoff

### Cover Installation

**Safety Covers**
- Ensure all anchors are secure and springs are properly tensioned
- Covers should be taut with no sagging

**Solid Covers**
- Use water bags or cover clips to secure
- Install a cover pump to remove standing water

## 4. Winter Care & Monitoring

### Monthly Checks

Even during winter, pools require periodic attention:

- **Water Level**: Check monthly; add water if level drops significantly below the cover
- **Cover Condition**: Remove debris, leaves, and standing water from cover
- **Pump Operation**: If using a cover pump, ensure it's functioning
- **Chemistry**: Test water once per month if accessible; maintain minimum sanitizer level

### Freeze Protection (Mild Climates)

If the pool stays open or partially open:
- Run the pump continuously when temperatures drop below freezing
- Install a freeze guard/sensor that automatically activates the pump
- Add a maintenance dose of algaecide mid-winter if a warm spell occurs

### Safety Considerations

- Ensure water bags (for above ground) or anchors (for safety covers) remain secure to prevent animals or children from slipping under the cover
- Never walk on a winter cover

## 5. Regional Considerations

### Cold Climates (Midwest, Northeast, Canada)

**Hard Close Required**
- You must lower water levels and blow out plumbing lines to prevent freezing damage
- Season typically runs May to September

**Open Late/Close Early**
- Shorter season means more aggressive opening/closing schedules

### Mild/Warm Climates (South, West Coast, Florida)

**Option to Stay Open**
- Many pools stay open year-round
- If freezing temperatures are forecast, **run the pump continuously** to keep water moving and prevent pipe damage

**Partial Winterization**
- If "closing" without draining/blowing lines in a non-freeze area, continue to run the pump for a few hours daily
- Maintain basic chemistry to prevent stagnation

**Deserts (AZ, NV)**
- High evaporation is a concern
- Use covers to retain water
- Be wary of heat buildup damaging pool surfaces if drained

### High Water Table Areas

**Draining Warning**
- Never completely drain a pool in areas with a high water table (near lakes, sea level, or after heavy rains)
- The hydrostatic pressure can float the pool shell out of the ground
- Always check the hydrostatic relief valve before draining
