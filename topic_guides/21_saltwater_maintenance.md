# Salt Water Pool Maintenance Guide

## Circulation Essentials

### Run Time Requirements
- **Warm/Hot Climates**: Run the filter and pump 8-12 hours a day (longer is better)
- **Cool/Cold Climates**: Run 4-6 hours a day minimum

### Skimmer and Pump Baskets
Keep the skimmer and pump basket(s) clear. This improves water flow to the filter system and ensures the salt cell receives adequate flow.

### Filter Pressure Monitoring
- Normal operating pressure is usually 10-20 PSI
- Backwash (or clean) when pressure rises 10 PSI above clean starting pressure
- Document baseline pressure after cleaning for reference

### Return Jet Adjustment
Angle return jets down and point them all in the same direction. This:
- Pushes debris to the surface for the skimmer(s)
- Helps mix in chemicals evenly
- Improves overall circulation

## Salt Cell Maintenance

### Quarterly Inspection
Inspect the salt cell every 3 months for calcium buildup.

### Cleaning Procedure
1. Remove the cell from the plumbing
2. Inspect for white, scaly buildup on the plates
3. If buildup is present, clean with one of these methods:
   - **Hose method**: Use high-pressure water to rinse off loose deposits
   - **Acid method**: Soak in diluted muriatic acid (4:1 water to acid ratio)
4. Rinse thoroughly before reinstalling

### Signs Cell Needs Cleaning
- Decreased chlorine output
- "Check Cell" or "Inspect Cell" warning on controller
- Visible calcium buildup on plates
- Higher than normal salt reading required

## Chemistry for Salt Water Pools

### Weekly Testing
Using test strips or a liquid test kit, check:
- pH (runs naturally high in salt water systems)
- Total Alkalinity
- Cyanuric Acid (CYA) levels

### Ideal Ranges

| Parameter | Ideal Range | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Chlorine | 3 ppm | Generated by salt cell |
| Salinity | 3,200 ppm | Check monthly against cell reading |
| pH | 7.5 | Monitor closely - runs high |
| Alkalinity | 100-150 ppm | Less effect on pH in salt systems |

### pH Management
pH runs naturally high in salt water systems due to the chlorine generation process. Monitor weekly and adjust as needed:
- Use pH decreaser (sodium bisulfate) to lower
- Muriatic acid can also lower pH
- pH increaser (sodium carbonate) if too low

### Alkalinity Notes
In salt water pools, alkalinity has less effect on pH than in traditional chlorine pools. Use baking soda to raise alkalinity if it's low.

### CYA Considerations
CYA levels can be kept slightly higher (50-80 ppm) if chlorine levels keep dropping, as this helps protect the chlorine generated by the cell from UV degradation.

## Monthly Salinity Testing

### Why Manual Testing Matters
- Salt cell readings can drift over time
- Manual testing confirms system accuracy
- Helps catch calibration issues early

### When to Add Salt
- After opening the pool for the season
- After heavy rain (dilution)
- After significant water replacement
- When salinity drops below 2,700 ppm

## Shocking Salt Water Pools

### Frequency
Shock every 1-2 weeks, or as needed based on:
- Bather load
- Weather conditions
- Algae presence
- Water clarity

### Recommended Methods

#### Boost Feature
Most salt water systems have a "BOOST" feature that increases chlorine production temporarily. This is the preferred method for routine shocking.

#### Non-Chlorine Shock (Oxidizer)
- Destroys contaminants
- Helps clear cloudy water
- Does not increase chlorine levels
- Safe to swim shortly after application

#### For Algae-Prone Pools
- Use dichlor shock (stabilized chlorine)
- Or liquid chlorine (sodium hypochlorite)

### What to Avoid
**Do NOT use calcium hypochlorite (cal-hypo) shock** in salt water pools. It can cause calcium buildup in the salt cell, reducing efficiency and lifespan.

## Winterization Considerations

### For Mild Climates
- Reduce run time but maintain circulation
- Continue cell operation at reduced output
- Monitor chemistry monthly

### For Freezing Climates
- Remove and store salt cell indoors
- Winterize plumbing as with traditional pools
- Clean cell before storage
- Reinstall and recalibrate in spring
