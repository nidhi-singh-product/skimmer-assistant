## 1. When NOT to Service a Pool

### Safety Red Flags - Do Not Service

**Electrical Hazards:**
- Exposed wiring near pool
- Damaged electrical boxes
- Equipment with burn marks
- Pump/motor making electrical sounds
- Water near electrical components

**Structural Hazards:**
- Cracked deck that's a trip hazard
- Loose coping or tiles
- Unstable equipment pads
- Unsecured gates (safety violation)

**Water Quality Hazards:**
- Extremely low/no chlorine + heavy use
- Visible fecal contamination
- Chemical spill or unusual conditions
- Unknown chemicals added by customer

**Access Issues:**
- Aggressive dogs not secured
- Unsafe entry conditions
- No clear path to equipment
- Locked gates without working code

### Document and Communicate

**When You Decline Service:**
1. Document the issue (photos)
2. Notify customer immediately
3. Explain safety concern clearly
4. Provide written notice
5. Offer to return when resolved
6. Follow up in writing

**Sample Communication:**
"I was unable to service your pool today due to [specific safety concern]. For the safety of everyone, this issue needs to be resolved before service can resume. Please contact me when this has been addressed."

### Liability Protection

**Protect Yourself:**
- Never work on unsafe conditions
- Document everything
- Don't perform work outside your expertise
- Know when to refer to licensed contractor
- Maintain proper insurance

## 2. Electrical Safety & Pool Bonding

### Pool Bonding 101

**What is Bonding?**
- Connecting all metal components to create equal electrical potential
- Prevents shock from voltage differences
- Required by electrical code (NEC)

**What Gets Bonded:**
- Handrails and ladders
- Light fixtures
- Pump motors
- Heater housing
- Metal coping
- Reinforcing steel in deck
- Diving boards
- Water (through metal fittings)

### Why Bonding Matters

**Without Proper Bonding:**
- Metal components can have different voltages
- Touching two components = potential shock
- Water can conduct electricity between components
- Corrosion accelerates

**Stray Voltage Symptoms:**
- Tingling sensation in water
- Shock when touching ladder/rail
- Equipment corrosion
- Customer complaints of "electricity"

### What to Look For

**Visual Inspection:**
- Green bonding wire visible at equipment
- Lugs tight and not corroded
- Continuous path to bonding grid
- No broken or disconnected wires

**When to Refer:**
- Any shock complaints - IMMEDIATELY stop service
- Visible bonding damage
- Equipment installation
- Code compliance questions

**Always refer electrical work to licensed electrician.**

## 3. Chemical Safety

### Chemical Handling Rules

**Never Mix Chemicals:**
- Chlorine + acid = toxic chlorine gas
- Different chlorine types = reaction
- Always add chemicals to water, not water to chemicals

**Personal Protective Equipment:**
| Chemical Type | PPE Required |
|---------------|--------------|
| Liquid chlorine | Gloves, eye protection |
| Acid | Gloves, eye protection, face shield |
| Cal-hypo | Gloves, avoid inhalation |
| All chemicals | Wash hands after handling |

**Storage:**
- Keep chemicals separated
- Store in cool, dry location
- Keep containers closed
- Away from heat sources
- Secure from children/unauthorized access

### Chemical Spill Response

**Small Spill (dry chemical):**
1. Wear PPE
2. Contain with absorbent material
3. Sweep into container
4. Dispose properly
5. Do not wash into storm drain

**Liquid Spill:**
1. Wear PPE
2. Contain spread
3. Absorb with appropriate material
4. Ventilate area if indoors
5. Dispose properly

**Large Spill or Reaction:**
1. Evacuate area
2. Call emergency services
3. Do not attempt cleanup
4. Stay upwind
5. Provide SDS to responders

### Chemical Transportation

- Keep chemicals in vehicle bed, not cab
- Secure containers from tipping
- Separate incompatible chemicals
- Keep SDS sheets accessible
- Don't leave in hot vehicle longer than necessary

## 4. Physical Safety

### Preventing Slips, Trips, Falls

**Common Hazards:**
- Wet decks
- Hoses and cords
- Uneven surfaces
- Pool covers
