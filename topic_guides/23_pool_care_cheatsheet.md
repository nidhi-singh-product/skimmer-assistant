# Pool Care Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

## Circulation Fundamentals

### Run Time Guidelines
| Climate | Daily Run Time |
|---------|---------------|
| Warm/Hot | 8-12 hours |
| Cool/Cold | 4-6 hours |

**Rule**: Longer run time is always better for water quality.

### Skimmer and Pump Baskets
- Keep baskets clear at all times
- Check at every service visit
- Clear baskets improve water flow to the filter system

### Filter Pressure
- Normal range: 10-20 PSI
- Backwash or clean when pressure rises 10 PSI above baseline
- Document baseline pressure after each cleaning

### Return Jet Adjustment
- Angle jets downward
- Point all in the same direction (circular flow)
- Pushes debris to surface for skimmer collection
- Helps mix chemicals evenly

## Cleaning Schedule

### Daily
- Skim the surface
- Skim with the flow of the water in a circular motion
- Stops debris from sinking to the bottom

### Weekly
- Brush walls, ladders, and hard-to-reach areas
- Vacuum the pool floor
- Vacuuming removes contaminants and prevents algae

### As Needed
- Clean filter (based on pressure reading)
- Empty pump basket
- Check automated cleaner function

## Water Chemistry Quick Reference

### Testing Frequency
- **Weekly**: pH, Chlorine, Alkalinity, CYA
- **Monthly**: Calcium Hardness, Salinity (salt pools)

### Ideal Ranges - Traditional Pools

| Parameter | Ideal Range |
|-----------|-------------|
| Alkalinity | 100-150 ppm |
| pH | 7.5 (range 7.4-7.6) |
| Free Chlorine | 1-3 ppm |
| Bromine | 4-6 ppm |
| Biguanide | 30-50 ppm |
| CYA | 30-50 ppm |

### Ideal Ranges - Salt Water Pools

| Parameter | Ideal Range |
|-----------|-------------|
| Chlorine | 3 ppm |
| Salinity | 3,200 ppm |
| pH | 7.5 |
| Alkalinity | 100-150 ppm |

### Water Balance Order
Always adjust in this order:
1. Total Alkalinity first
2. pH second
3. Sanitizer third

## Shocking Protocol

### Frequency
Every 1-2 weeks, or when needed based on:
- Heavy bather load
- Rainstorms
- Algae presence
- Cloudy water

### Shock Types

#### Non-Chlorine Shock (Oxidizer)
- Destroys contaminants
- Clears cloudy water
- No chlorine added
- Can swim soon after

#### Chlorine Shock Options
- Liquid chlorine (sodium hypochlorite)
- Dichlor (stabilized - adds CYA)
- Cal-hypo (NOT for salt water pools - causes calcium buildup)

## Salt Water Pool Specifics

### Salt Cell Maintenance
- Inspect every 3 months
- Clean with hose or diluted muriatic acid (4:1 water:acid)
- Look for white calcium buildup on plates

### pH Management
- pH runs naturally high in salt systems
- Monitor weekly
- Use muriatic acid or pH decreaser to lower

### Boost Mode
Use the "BOOST" feature on your salt system for routine shocking instead of adding chemicals.

## Emergency Quick Reference

### Green Pool (Algae Bloom)
1. Brush all surfaces
2. Shock heavily (3-4x normal dose)
3. Run pump 24/7 until clear
4. Vacuum to waste
5. Clean filter frequently during process

### Cloudy Water
1. Test all chemistry
2. Adjust pH and alkalinity
3. Run pump continuously
4. Add clarifier if needed
5. Clean filter

### No Suction/Prime Loss
1. Check skimmer baskets
2. Check pump basket
3. Look for air leaks at pump lid
4. Check water level in pool
5. Inspect for clogged impeller

## Safety Reminders

### Chemical Handling
- Never mix chemicals
- Add chemicals to water, not water to chemicals
- Store chemicals properly (cool, dry, separated)
- Use proper PPE

### Electrical Safety
- Ensure disconnect is within 50 feet
- All knockouts must be sealed
- Never work on equipment with power on

### Documentation
- Log all readings
- Log all chemicals added
- Take photos (pool and equipment)
- Send service report before leaving
