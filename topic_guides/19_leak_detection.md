# Leak Detection and Diagnostics

## Dye Testing Fundamentals

Dye testing is a fundamental technique used to confirm the location of a suspected structural leak in a pool.

## Dye Testing Procedure

1. **Turn all equipment OFF** - The water must be completely calm with no currents
2. **Approach slowly** - Move toward the suspected leak area (around a return fitting, a crack, or a skimmer throat) slowly to avoid disturbing the water
3. **Release dye carefully** - Using a dye tester syringe, release a very small, fine ribbon of dye close to the suspected leak area
4. **Observe the dye movement** - If there is a leak, you will see the ribbon of dye being pulled out of the pool into the crack or gap

### Important Technique Notes
- Do NOT squirt a large cloud of dye into the water - this will not help identify the leak's location
- Use a fine, controlled ribbon of dye
- Be patient and watch carefully for subtle movement
- Test multiple suspected areas if needed

## Common Surface Problems and Causes

### Wall Bulges in Fiberglass Pools
Most often caused by using sand as a backfill material instead of clean, crushed stone. When sand becomes saturated with ground water, it can liquefy and shift, creating uneven pressure that pushes the pool wall inward.

### Plumbing Leaks at the Shell
Can also be caused by improper backfill. When sand or other unstable material settles over time, it drags the plumbing lines down with it, putting immense stress on the connection points at the pool wall and causing leaks.

### Surface Discoloration and Fading
While this can be a sign of a low-quality gel coat finish, it is also frequently caused by a failure to maintain proper water chemistry over time. Consistently poor water balance can break down even the best surfaces prematurely.

## Diagnosing Hydraulic Inefficiency

Poor plumbing practices on the equipment pad can cripple the performance of even the best equipment, leading to priming issues, cavitation, and premature pump failure.

### Common Plumbing Errors That Harm Performance

#### Overuse of Street 90s
These fittings are extremely restrictive and create significant resistance, starving the pump for water. Each 1.5" Street 90 adds the equivalent resistance of 12-15 feet of straight pipe.

#### Insufficient Straight Pipe
Pump manuals specify 8-12 inches of straight pipe before the pump inlet and after the pump outlet. Placing a 90-degree elbow directly at the pump inlet will cause turbulence, limit the pump's ability to prime, and lead to damaging cavitation.

#### Improper Pipe Sizing (Bottlenecks)
Drastically changing pipe sizes in a short run (e.g., from 1.5" to 2" and back down to 1.25") creates significant back pressure and resistance, forcing the pump to work harder.

## Signs of a Pool Leak

### Water Loss Indicators
- Losing more than 1/4 inch of water per day (beyond normal evaporation)
- Need to add water more than once per week
- Autofill system running constantly
- Higher than normal water bills

### Structural Indicators
- Cracks in pool deck or coping
- Settling around the pool
- Soggy or wet spots in the yard
- Air bubbles in the return lines

### Equipment Indicators
- Pump losing prime frequently
- Air in the pump basket
- Unusual sounds from equipment
- Decreased water pressure

## Bucket Test for Evaporation vs. Leak

### Procedure
1. Fill a bucket with pool water and place it on the pool step
2. Mark the water level inside the bucket
3. Mark the water level on the pool wall
4. Wait 24-48 hours (no rain)
5. Compare the water loss in the bucket vs. the pool

### Interpretation
- If pool loses more water than bucket: likely a leak
- If both lose the same amount: normal evaporation
- Repeat test with pump on and off to isolate plumbing vs. structural leaks

## When to Refer to Leak Detection Specialist

- Unable to locate leak with dye testing
- Suspected underground plumbing leak
- Multiple suspected leak locations
- Leak rate exceeds 1 inch per day
- Structural damage present
