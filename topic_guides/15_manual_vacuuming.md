# Manual Vacuuming Procedures

## Equipment Required

- Vacuum head (vac head)
- Telescopic pole
- Vacuum hose (long enough to reach all areas of the pool)
- Skim vac plate (optional, but recommended)

## Filter Settings: Filter vs. Waste

Before beginning, the technician must select the correct filter setting based on the debris load.

### FILTER Setting
Use for routine cleaning with light debris. This sends water through the filter media and returns clean water to the pool. A backwash will likely be required after vacuuming.

### WASTE Setting
Use for heavy debris or algae infestations. This bypasses the filter entirely, pumping the dirty water out of the pool to prevent clogging the filter media. CRITICAL: The technician must add fresh water with a garden hose during this process to maintain the pool's water level.

## Priming the Hose

To create suction, all air must be purged from the vacuum hose before connecting it to the skimmer.

1. Attach the vac head to the pole and one end of the hose to the vac head
2. Place the entire assembly into the pool, letting the vac head sink to the floor
3. Take the free end of the hose and hold it firmly against a return jet
4. Water flowing from the jet will push all the air out of the hose
5. You will see bubbles coming from the vac head
6. Once the bubbles stop, the hose is full of water and primed

## Proper Vacuuming Technique

1. Connect the primed hose to the skimmer suction line (either into the suction hole or onto a skim vac plate)
2. Suction should begin immediately
3. Use long, slow, sweeping strokes to vacuum the pool floor
4. Ensure your strokes overlap slightly to avoid missing any spots
5. Do not rush - moving too quickly will kick up debris, clouding the water and requiring it to resettle

### Why Slow Vacuuming Matters
Rushing kicks up fine particles that will simply resettle, leading to a customer callback and wasting company time and fuel. The vacuuming process requires a deliberate and methodical approach to be effective.

## Post-Vacuum Tasks

After vacuuming is complete:

1. Brush the pool walls and steps
2. Empty the pump strainer basket
3. If you used the "Filter" setting, backwash the filter
4. If you used the "Waste" setting and added significant fresh water, test the water again and adjust chemistry as needed
5. Rinse all equipment (brushes, poles, hoses) with fresh water and store properly

### Cross-Contamination Prevention
Rinsing equipment after each use is a non-negotiable step that prevents cross-contamination between pools and extends the life of company assets.

## Automated Cleaner Checks

For pools with pressure-side automated cleaners (e.g., Polaris), perform a quick functional check.

### Common Polaris Issues

| Symptom | Likely Cause/Solution |
|---------|----------------------|
| Backup valve is firing continuously | The backup valve has failed and must be replaced |
| Cleaner is on its side or not staying on the pool floor | The rear float has likely cracked and filled with water. It needs to be replaced |
| The hose is constantly tangled | The hose may be too long for the pool, or a swivel may be needed to allow the sections to rotate freely |
| Cleaner is not moving or is sluggish | Check the in-line filter screen (at the wall connection) for debris. This screen often clogs after a filter cleaning or backwash |

## Weekly Cleaning Routine Summary

1. **Skim the surface daily** - This stops debris from sinking to the bottom and less to vacuum. Skim with the flow of the water in a circular motion.

2. **Brush and vacuum weekly** - Brush walls, ladders, and hard to reach areas. Vacuuming removes contaminants and prevents algae.

3. **Empty baskets** - Keep the skimmer and pump basket(s) clear. This improves water flow to the filter system.
