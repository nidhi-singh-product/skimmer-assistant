# Water Chemistry Guide for Pool Service Technicians

## Overview
Water chemistry is the foundation of pool maintenance. Proper balance prevents equipment damage, ensures swimmer safety, and maintains water clarity.

## 1. pH Levels

### Ideal Range
- **Target**: 7.4 - 7.6
- **Acceptable**: 7.2 - 7.8
- **Critical Low**: Below 7.0 (acidic - causes corrosion)
- **Critical High**: Above 8.0 (scale formation, chlorine ineffective)

### Why pH Matters
- Controls chlorine effectiveness (chlorine is 50% less effective at pH 8.0 vs 7.2)
- Affects swimmer comfort (eyes, skin irritation)
- Impacts equipment longevity (pumps, heaters, surfaces)

### Adjustment Procedures
**To Raise pH (if too low):**
- Add soda ash (sodium carbonate)
- Dosage: 6 oz per 10,000 gallons raises pH by 0.2

**To Lower pH (if too high):**
- Add muriatic acid or dry acid (sodium bisulfate)
- Dosage: 1 pint muriatic acid per 10,000 gallons lowers pH by 0.2

## 2. Chlorine Management

### Types of Chlorine
| Type | Best Use | CYA Content | Notes |
|------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Cal-Hypo (Calcium Hypochlorite) | Shocking | None | Raises calcium hardness |
| Dichlor (Sodium Dichloro-s-triazinetrione) | Regular chlorination | Contains CYA | Stabilized, good for outdoor |
| Trichlor Tablets | Tab feeders | Contains CYA | Slow dissolve, acidic |
| Liquid Chlorine (Sodium Hypochlorite) | Quick treatment | None | No residue, short shelf life |

### Free Chlorine vs Total Chlorine
- **Free Chlorine (FC)**: Available to sanitize - TARGET: 1-3 ppm
- **Combined Chlorine (CC)**: Used up chlorine (chloramines) - should be < 0.5 ppm
- **Total Chlorine (TC)**: FC + CC

**If CC > 0.5 ppm**: Pool needs shocking (breakpoint chlorination)

### Shocking Procedures
1. Test current chlorine and CYA levels
2. Calculate shock dose based on FC needed
3. Add shock at dusk (UV degrades chlorine)
4. Run pump for 8+ hours
5. Retest next morning

## 3. Total Alkalinity (TA)

### Ideal Range
- **Standard pools**: 80-120 ppm
- **Saltwater pools**: 80-100 ppm (lower end preferred)

### Why Alkalinity Matters
- Acts as pH buffer (prevents pH bounce)
- Too low = pH instability, corrosion
- Too high = pH difficult to adjust, cloudy water

### Adjustment Procedures
**To Raise TA:**
- Add sodium bicarbonate (baking soda)
- Dosage: 1.5 lbs per 10,000 gallons raises TA by 10 ppm

**To Lower TA:**
- Add muriatic acid in small doses
- Aerate water to off-gas CO2
- Lower in increments of 10 ppm, retest after 24 hours

## 4. Calcium Hardness

### Ideal Ranges by Pool Type
| Pool Type | Ideal Range | Why Different |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Plaster/Gunite | 200-275 ppm | Protects plite surface |
| Vinyl | 175-225 ppm | Lower to prevent scaling |
| Fiberglass | 175-225 ppm | Lower tolerance |
| Saltwater | 200-400 ppm | Salt cells need protection |

### Why Calcium Matters
- Too low: Water becomes aggressive, etches plaster, corrodes metal
- Too high: Scale formation on surfaces, equipment, salt cells

### Adjustment Procedures
**To Raise Calcium:**
- Add calcium chloride
- Dosage: 1.25 lbs per 10,000 gallons raises CH by 10 ppm
- Add slowly, pre-dissolve in bucket

**To Lower Calcium:**
- Partial drain and refill with fresh water
- No chemical method to lower calcium

## 5. Cyanuric Acid (CYA) / Stabilizer

### Ideal Ranges
- **Standard chlorine pools**: 30-50 ppm
- **Saltwater pools**: 60-80 ppm
- **Indoor pools**: 0-30 ppm (less UV exposure)

### The 7.5% Rule
- Free Chlorine should be 7.5% of CYA level
- Example: CYA at 50 ppm → FC target = 3.75 ppm

### Why CYA Matters
- Protects chlorine from UV degradation
- Too low: Chlorine burns off quickly
- Too high: Chlorine becomes ineffective (chlorine lock)

### Management
**To Raise CYA:**
- Add cyanuric acid (stabilizer)
- Or use stabilized chlorine (dichlor, trichlor)

**To Lower CYA:**
- Partial drain and refill (only method)
- Dilution calculation: 50% drain = 50% CYA reduction

## 6. Common Water Problems

### Green Water / Algae

**Severity Assessment:**
| Color | Severity | Shock Dose |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Teal/Light Green | Mild | 2 lbs cal-hypo per 10,000 gal |
| Green | Moderate | 3 lbs cal-hypo per 10,000 gal |
| Dark Green | Severe | 4 lbs cal-hypo per 10,000 gal |
| Black/Swamp | Extreme | Consider drain, acid wash |

**Treatment Steps:**
1. Brush all surfaces thoroughly
2. Vacuum to waste (bypass filter)
3. Test and balance pH to 7.2
4. Add appropriate shock dose
5. Run pump 24/7 until clear
6. Backwash filter as pressure rises
7. Vacuum dead algae
8. Rebalance chemistry

### Cloudy Water

**Common Causes:**
- High pH (>7.8)
- Low chlorine
- High calcium
- Poor filtration
- High TDS (total dissolved solids)

**Troubleshooting:**
1. Test all chemistry levels
2. Balance pH and alkalinity first
3. Shock if chlorine low
4. Check filter pressure
5. Run pump longer (8-12 hours)
6. Consider clarifier or flocculant
