# New Technician Training Fundamentals

## The Modern Pool Service Professional

The modern pool service industry is evolving rapidly, moving beyond simple maintenance to a discipline that demands exceptional professionalism, deep technical expertise, and operational excellence. The most successful technicians combine true craftsmanship with smart business practices, are adept communicators, and understand that their role is not just to service a pool, but to manage a key asset for their clients.

## Realities of the Field: Beyond the Poolside

As a service business grows, responsibilities extend far beyond the physical work performed at the equipment pad. Key administrative duties include:

- **Client Communication**: Managing calls, texts, and emails from new and existing customers
- **Estimates and Proposals**: Accurately assessing jobs and creating timely estimates
- **Billing and Invoicing**: Ensuring all work is properly billed and payments collected
- **Scheduling and Routing**: Managing routes for efficiency and timely service
- **Hiring and Management**: As the business expands, adding and managing team members

## Core Safety Protocols

### Chemical Safety
Technicians work with chemicals that can be hazardous if handled improperly. Understanding chemical hazards and following OSHA safety procedures is a core competency.

### Electrical Safety
The equipment pad is an environment where water and high-voltage electricity are in close proximity.

#### Electrical Hazard Checklist
- **Means of Disconnect**: By code, must be within 50 feet of equipment and within sight. A timer box without a disconnect switch is not compliant.
- **Exposed Knockouts**: All boxes and panels must be sealed. Open knockouts are a code violation and shock hazard.

## Understanding Pool Equipment

### The Circulation System

#### Pumps
The pump is the heart of the circulation system.

**Single-Speed Pumps**: Operate at one high speed, notoriously inefficient.

**Variable-Speed Pumps (VSPs)**: Allow precise flow control, running at lower speeds for longer periods with massive energy savings.

#### Energy Savings Calculation
A technician can calculate VSP upgrade value using this formula:

**Monthly Cost = (kW) × (Cost per kWh) × (Run Time per Day) × 30 Days**

Example:
- 1.5 HP single-speed at 2,000 watts for 10 hours/day at $0.10/kWh = $60/month
- VSP at 500 watts for 20 hours/day at $0.10/kWh = $30/month
- **Savings: 50% while doubling filtration time**

### Filters
The filter removes dirt and debris from the water.

**Types**:
- Sand filters
- D.E. (diatomaceous earth) filters
- Cartridge filters

**Sizing is Critical**: Installing a filter too small for the pool volume is a major disservice to the client, leading to poor circulation and higher chemical costs.

### Heaters
Heaters extend swimming season and heat spas. Four elements must be present:
1. Water
2. Electricity
3. Air
4. Gas

**Never bypass a safety switch**—they prevent catastrophic failure, fire, or carbon monoxide poisoning.

## Standardized Service Routine

Following a consistent process ensures no detail is overlooked.

### Manual Vacuuming Protocol
1. Select correct filter setting (Filter vs. Waste)
2. Prime the vacuum hose against a return jet
3. Use long, slow, sweeping strokes
4. Overlap strokes slightly
5. Don't rush—kicking up debris wastes time and causes callbacks

### Post-Service Procedures
1. Clean pump strainer basket
2. Backwash filter if pressure is high (10 PSI above baseline)
3. Return filter valve to "Filter" setting if changed
4. Rinse all equipment with fresh water (prevents cross-contamination)
5. Store equipment properly

## Troubleshooting Skills

### Common Polaris Cleaner Issues

| Symptom | Cause/Solution |
|---------|---------------|
| Backup valve fires continuously | Valve failed, needs replacement |
| Cleaner on its side | Rear float waterlogged, replace |
| Hose constantly tangled | Hose too long or needs swivel |
| Not moving or sluggish | Check in-line filter screen for debris |
