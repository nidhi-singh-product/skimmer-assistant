## 1. Green Water / Algae

### Severity Assessment
| Color | Level | Visibility | Approach |
|-------|-------|------------|----------|
| Light Teal/Hazy Green | Mild | Can see bottom | Chemical treatment |
| Green | Moderate | Barely see bottom | Heavy shock + brush |
| Dark Green | Severe | Cannot see bottom | Aggressive treatment |
| Black/Swamp | Extreme | Murky/opaque | Consider drain & clean |

### Step-by-Step Algae Treatment

**Step 1: Prepare**
- Test current chemistry (FC, pH, CYA)
- Note: Standard shocking won't work if CYA is too high

**Step 2: Brush Everything**
- Brush walls, floor, steps, ladders
- Break up algae biofilm so chlorine can penetrate
- This step is critical - don't skip

**Step 3: Balance pH**
- Lower pH to 7.2 (chlorine more effective)
- Don't worry about TA yet

**Step 4: Calculate Shock Dose**
Based on severity (using Cal-Hypo):
| Severity | Dose per 10,000 gal |
|----------|---------------------|
| Light green | 2 lbs |
| Green | 3 lbs |
| Dark green | 4 lbs |
| Severe | 5+ lbs |

**Step 5: Add Shock**
- Add at dusk (UV destroys chlorine)
- Broadcast around pool
- Run pump 24/7

**Step 6: Monitor and Maintain**
- Brush daily
- Test FC every 8-12 hours
- Re-shock if FC drops below 2-3 ppm
- Backwash filter when pressure rises 8-10 PSI
- Continue until water is clear AND FC holds overnight

**Step 7: Vacuum Dead Algae**
- Vacuum to waste if possible
- May need to vacuum multiple times
- Clean filter after vacuuming

**Step 8: Rebalance Chemistry**
- Adjust all parameters to normal ranges
- Consider algaecide for prevention

### Why Pool Still Green After Shocking

**Cause 1: Not Enough Chlorine**
- Solution: Shock harder, maintain FC level

**Cause 2: CYA Too High**
- Above 100 ppm, chlorine becomes ineffective
- Solution: Partial drain to lower CYA

**Cause 3: pH Too High**
- Solution: Lower pH to 7.0-7.2 for treatment

**Cause 4: Not Running Pump Long Enough**
- Solution: Run 24/7 until clear

**Cause 5: Filter Not Cleaned**
- Dead algae clogs filter quickly
- Solution: Backwash frequently during treatment

**Cause 6: Not Brushing**
- Algae film protects from chlorine
- Solution: Brush daily during treatment

## 2. Cloudy Water

### Common Causes & Solutions

**Chemistry-Related:**
| Cause | Test | Solution |
|-------|------|----------|
| High pH | Test pH | Lower to 7.4-7.6 |
| Low chlorine | Test FC | Shock pool |
| High calcium | Test CH | Partial drain or use clarifier |
| High TDS | TDS meter | Partial drain & refill |

**Filtration-Related:**
| Cause | Check | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Dirty filter | Pressure gauge | Clean/backwash |
| Short run time | Timer | Increase to 8-12 hours |
| Undersized filter | GPM rating | Upgrade equipment |
| Air in system | Bubbles in return | Find and fix air leak |

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. Test all chemistry parameters
2. Balance pH and chlorine first
3. Shock if chlorine is low
4. Check filter pressure - clean if high
5. Increase pump run time
6. If persists: use clarifier
7. If still cloudy: vacuum to waste with flocculant

### Using Clarifier vs Flocculant

**Clarifier:**
- Clumps particles so filter can catch them
- Add to skimmer, run pump
- Takes 24-48 hours
- Good for mild cloudiness

**Flocculant:**
- Drops particles to floor
- Add, run pump 2 hours, then off for 12-24 hours
- Vacuum to waste (bypass filter)
- Good for severe cloudiness

## 3. Pool Leak Detection

### The Bucket Test

**Purpose:** Determine if water loss is evaporation or a leak

**Procedure:**
1. Fill bucket with pool water, place on step
2. Mark water level inside bucket AND pool water level outside bucket
3. Turn off auto-fill
4. Wait 24 hours (pump running normally)
5. Compare both marks

**Results:**
- Both dropped equally = Evaporation only
- Pool dropped more than bucket = LEAK

**Tip:** Repeat with pump off 24 hours to determine if leak is in plumbing or shell

### Leak Detection Steps

**Step 1: Determine Leak Type**
- Pump on vs pump off test
- Pump on: Leak may be in return plumbing
- Pump off: Leak in shell or suction side

**Step 2: Visual Inspection**
- Check equipment pad for wet spots
- Inspect all visible plumbing connections
- Look for cracks in pool shell
- Check skimmers and returns for gaps

**Step 3: Dye Testing**
- Use leak detection dye at suspected areas
- Dye will flow toward leak
- Check: lights, returns, skimmers, cracks

**Step 4: Pressure Testing (Advanced)**
- Plug lines and pressurize
- Monitors for pressure drop
- Identifies which line is leaking

### Common Leak Locations
1. **Main drain** - Use dye test
2. **Skimmer** - Check throat, connection to pipe
3. **Return fittings** - Feel for loose fittings
4. **Light niche** - Very common, check conduit
5. **Underground plumbing** - May need professional
6. **Pump/filter connections** - Visual inspection

## 4. Pump Problems

### Pump Won't Prime
See Equipment - Pumps guide for detailed troubleshooting

**Quick Checklist:**
1. Water level in pool adequate?
2. Strainer basket clear?
3. Lid O-ring in good condition?
4. All valves open?
5. Air bubbles visible? (indicates air leak)

### Pump Making Noise

| Sound | Likely Cause | Solution |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Screaming/screeching | Bad bearings | Replace bearings or motor |
| Grinding | Debris in impeller | Clear impeller |
| Cavitation (gravel sound) | Starved for water | Check suction, increase flow |
| Humming (not starting) | Capacitor or seized | Test capacitor, check motor |

### Pump Losing Prime

**Causes:**
1. Air leak on suction side
2. Low water level
3. Clogged impeller (weak suction)
4. Worn shaft seal (allows air)
5. Cracked suction line

## 5. Heater Problems

### Heater Won't Start
See Equipment - Heaters guide for detailed troubleshooting

**Quick Checklist:**
1. Power on? Breaker OK?
2. Thermostat calling for heat?
3. Gas supply on?
4. Pump running? (pressure switch)
5. Any error codes displayed?

### Heater Cycles On/Off (Short Cycling)

**Common Causes:**
1. Low water flow - clean filter, open valves
2. High limit tripping - check for blockage
3. Scale in heat exchanger - descale
4. Incorrect bypass valve setting - adjust
5. Oversized heater for application - reduce output

## 6. Water Chemistry Emergencies

### Chlorine Lock (Very High CYA)
**Symptom:** Can't maintain chlorine despite adding
**Solution:** Partial drain and refill to lower CYA

### pH Crash (Below 7.0)
**Symptom:** Corrosive water, eye/skin irritation
**Solution:** Add soda ash slowly, monitor closely

### Chlorine Demand (After Party/Heavy Use)
**Symptom:** Chlorine disappears quickly
**Solution:** Superchlorinate, test every few hours

### High Combined Chlorine (Chloramines)
**Symptom:** Strong "chlorine" smell, eye irritation
**Test:** TC - FC > 0.5 ppm
**Solution:** Breakpoint chlorination (10x shock)

## 7. Emergency Response Quick Reference

| Emergency | Immediate Action |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Green pool | Don't panic - it's fixable with proper shock treatment |
| Leak suspected | Bucket test first, then systematic inspection |
| Pump won't start | Check power, then check for air/priming issues |
| No chlorine reading | Check CYA level, then shock |
| Heater error | Note code, check flow and gas supply |
| Eye/skin irritation | Test pH first - likely out of range |
| Strong chlorine smell | Actually means NOT enough chlorine (chloramines) |

## 8. Troubleshooting Decision Tree

### Water Clarity Issue
```
Cloudy Water?
├── Test Chemistry
│   ├── pH high? → Lower pH
│   ├── Chlorine low? → Shock
│   └── Calcium high? → Partial drain
├── Check Filter
│   ├── Pressure high? → Clean/backwash
│   └── Pressure normal? → Increase run time
└── Still cloudy? → Use clarifier/flocculant
```

### Water Loss
```
Losing Water?
├── Do Bucket Test
│   ├── Equal loss → Evaporation (normal)
│   └── Pool lost more → LEAK
├── Test: Pump On vs Off
│   ├── Loses more pump ON → Pressure side leak
│   └── Loses more pump OFF → Shell/suction leak
└── Dye test suspected areas
```
