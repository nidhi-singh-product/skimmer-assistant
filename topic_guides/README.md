## Usage for Lovable RAG App

These markdown files can be:
1. **Imported directly** into a vector database
2. **Chunked** by section headers for better retrieval
3. **Enhanced** with additional content from NotebookLM exports
4. **Validated** against the RAG evaluation framework

### Recommended Chunking Strategy
- Split by ## (H2 headers) for topic-level chunks
- Keep tables intact
- Preserve code blocks and lists
- Include file name as metadata
