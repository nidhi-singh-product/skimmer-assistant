# Saltwater Pool Care Guide for Service Technicians

## Overview
Saltwater pools use a salt chlorine generator (SCG) to produce chlorine from dissolved salt. They require specialized knowledge beyond traditional chlorine pool care.

## 1. How Saltwater Systems Work

### The Process (Electrolysis)
1. Salt (NaCl) is dissolved in pool water
2. Saltwater passes through the salt cell
3. Electrical charge separates salt into sodium and chlorine
4. Chlorine sanitizes the pool
5. Chlorine recombines with sodium, becoming salt again
6. Cycle continues (salt is not consumed)

### Key Components
- **Salt Cell**: Contains titanium plates coated with ruthenium/iridium
- **Control Unit**: Adjusts chlorine output, monitors cell
- **Flow Sensor**: Ensures adequate water flow through cell

### Salt Cell Lifespan
- Typical: 3-7 years (10,000-20,000 hours)
- Depends on: usage, water chemistry, maintenance
- Signs of wear: reduced output, visible scaling, error codes

## 2. Saltwater Chemistry Requirements

### Salt Levels
| Level | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 2700-3400 ppm | Ideal | Monitor monthly |
| 2500-2700 ppm | Low | Add salt |
| 3400-3600 ppm | High | Dilute (partial drain) |
| Below 2500 ppm | Critical | System won't generate |

### Salt Addition Calculation
**Rule:** 30 lbs of salt raises 10,000 gallons by ~350 ppm

**Example:**
- Pool: 15,000 gallons
- Current salt: 2500 ppm
- Target: 3200 ppm (need to raise 700 ppm)
- Calculation: (700 ÷ 350) × (15,000 ÷ 10,000) × 30 = 90 lbs of salt

### How to Add Salt
1. Calculate amount needed
2. Broadcast salt around pool perimeter
3. Avoid pouring directly near equipment
4. Brush pool floor to help dissolve
5. Run pump for 24 hours
6. Retest after 24-48 hours

## 3. Special Chemistry Considerations

### Cyanuric Acid (CYA)
- **Target for saltwater**: 60-80 ppm (higher than traditional)
- Protects chlorine from UV, especially important since salt cells produce unstabilized chlorine
- Test monthly, adjust as needed

### Calcium Hardness
- **Target**: 200-400 ppm
- Salt cells are sensitive to calcium scaling
- Too low: Cell damage from aggressive water
- Too high: Scale buildup on cell plates

### pH Management
- Salt systems naturally raise pH over time
- Monitor more frequently (2x per week in season)
- Keep muriatic acid on hand
- Target: 7.2-7.6

### Total Alkalinity
- **Target for saltwater**: 80-100 ppm (lower end)
- Lower TA helps control pH rise
- Balance TA before adjusting pH

## 4. Why Salt System Not Generating Chlorine

### Troubleshooting Checklist

**1. Salt Level Too Low**
- Check: Salt reading on control panel
- Test: Independent salt test (strips or electronic)
- Fix: Add salt if below 2500-2700 ppm

**2. Cell Needs Cleaning**
- Check: Inspect cell for white scale buildup
- Test: Visual inspection, output reading
- Fix: Clean cell (see cleaning procedure)

**3. Flow Switch/Sensor Issue**
- Check: "No Flow" or "Low Flow" error
- Test: Verify pump is running, filter is clean
- Fix: Clean sensor, check plumbing

**4. Cell at End of Life**
- Check: Cell age, "Inspect Cell" warnings
- Test: Output percentage vs actual chlorine produced
- Fix: Replace cell

**5. Water Temperature Too Low**
- Check: Water temp (most cells won't run below 50-60°F)
- Note: Normal in winter/early spring
- Fix: Wait for warmer temps or use backup chlorine

**6. Control Board Issue**
- Check: Display errors, no power
- Test: Verify power supply, reset system
- Fix: Replace board if faulty

## 5. Salt Cell Cleaning

### When to Clean
- Scale visible on cell plates
- Reduced chlorine output
- "Inspect Cell" message
- Every 3-6 months preventatively

### Cleaning Procedure
**Acid Wash Method:**

1. Turn off system
2. Remove cell from housing
3. Inspect plates for scale (white calcium deposits)
4. Mix cleaning solution:
   - Option A: 4 parts water : 1 part muriatic acid
   - Option B: Cell cleaning solution per manufacturer
5. Submerge cell in solution (use cell stand or bucket)
6. Soak for 5-15 minutes (watch for bubbling)
7. Do NOT scrape plates - acid does the work
8. Rinse thoroughly with garden hose
9. Inspect - repeat if scale remains
10. Reinstall cell
11. Turn system back on

### Cleaning Tips
- Never use more than 1:4 acid ratio
- Don't over-clean (reduces cell life)
- Clean less if water chemistry is balanced
- Consider using cell protector products

## 6. Common Saltwater Pool Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Ignoring pH
**Problem:** pH rises constantly in saltwater pools
**Solution:** Test 2-3x per week, keep muriatic acid ready

### Mistake 2: Not Adding Stabilizer
**Problem:** CYA too low, chlorine burns off quickly
**Solution:** Maintain CYA at 60-80 ppm for saltwater

### Mistake 3: Over-Relying on the Salt System
**Problem:** Expecting it to handle everything
**Solution:** Still need to shock occasionally, especially after heavy use

### Mistake 4: Running Output Too High
**Problem:** Cell wears out faster, wastes energy
**Solution:** Set output to maintain 1-3 ppm FC, not max

### Mistake 5: Not Cleaning Cell Regularly
**Problem:** Scale buildup reduces efficiency and lifespan
**Solution:** Inspect monthly, clean when needed

### Mistake 6: Wrong Salt Type
**Problem:** Using rock salt or softener salt with additives
**Solution:** Use only pool-grade salt (99.8% pure NaCl)

### Mistake 7: Adding Salt When System Shows Low
**Problem:** Control panel salt reading may be inaccurate
**Solution:** Always test independently before adding salt

### Mistake 8: Neglecting Calcium Hardness
**Problem:** Low calcium damages cell; high calcium causes scaling
**Solution:** Maintain 200-400 ppm

### Mistake 9: Not Running Pump Long Enough
**Problem:** Cell only generates chlorine when water flows
**Solution:** Run pump 8-12 hours for proper generation
